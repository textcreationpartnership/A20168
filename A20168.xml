            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As the Lord hath honoured you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of place, ſo he hath doubly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured you with grace and vertue. Amongſt the reſt of the rare endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith God hath inriched your honourable perſon, I obſerue theſe in particular: Firſt, humility,, a grace hard to be found in great perſonages. Secondly, loue to Gods houſe; your Honours diligence in this kind will riſe vp in iudgement againſt many proud deſpiſers of holy things, and will condemne them. Thirdly, Chriſtian gouernment in your family. I could name many more, but it is needleſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are better knowne then I can expreſſe them. Your ſingular vertues, together with the experience which I haue of your loue in the beſt things, do encourage me to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this ſmall worke vnto your Honor. The moſt part of this Chapter was preached in your hearing, and conſidering you vouchſafed to heare it preached with ioy and great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I make no doubt but your honour will accept it, and as diligently reade it now, as before you heard it. Good Madam,
<pb facs="tcp:10122:3"/> I know God hath laid vpon you a great triall of affliction, in that he hath taken away your noble ſonne Sir <hi>Ferdinando Dudley.</hi> But I beſeech you conſider whither he is remoued, to wit, from earth to heauen; his great zeale in Religion, eſpecially in his later yeares with the fruit thereof, do giue ſufficient testimonie of his preſent happineſſe. Who would not be content that their deareſt friend ſhould be aduanced? Behold, he is aduanced to a Crowne, yea to a Crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which ſhall neuer be taken from him, nor he from it. If the dead in Chriſt were to ſpeake vnto vs, they would ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay to vs that mourne for them; Weepe not for vs, for we are in bliſſe and happineſſe. And ſo, if this worthie ſonne were to ſpeake vnto you, he would ſay vnto you (ſeeing your teares) My honourable Mother weepe not for me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my happineſſe. The Church of God hath the greateſt loſſe in the death of this worthy Saint. She hath too few ſuch fauourers as he was: but all muſt ſubmit to the will of God; the will of the Lord is good, the Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord. He is taken away from beholding the euill to come; and we are left ſtill for our further triall; the Lord ſanctifie our croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vnto vs. Sorrow for ſuch a ſonne ſhall be no hinderance (as I hope) but rather a furtherance to your Honours zeale. This ſhall make you more mindfull of mortalitie, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to worke out your owne ſaluation, more induſtrious in the ſtudy of heauenly things. And indeed it nearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth euery Chriſtian, to haue eſpeciall reſpect vnto Gods word in the time of affliction: for whence can any expect ſound comfort in time of trouble but from the word, or whence ſtrength to beare afflictions, but from the ſame word? The word of God is as the balme of <hi>Gilead:</hi> We muſt flie vnto it to be healed of our ſorrowes. The word of
<pb facs="tcp:10122:3"/> God is as a ſtrong Tower, we muſt runne vnto it, if we would be ſafe from ſpirituall dangers. Now Gods word is not onely that which is expreſly written in the Bible, but alſo the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Gods ſeruants in expounding and preaching, ſo far as they deliuer nothing but that which hath warrant from the Scripture, this is alſo Gods word. And in this word we muſt be conuerſant as well as in the former; though in the former principally, becauſe it was by immediate reuelation. But I ſhall not neede to prouoke your Honour to the ſtudy of Gods word, for I am perſwaded you are taught of God. I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſeech your acceptation and patronage for this little Booke; and ſo reſt</p>

               <p>The Preface conſiſts of three parts; firſt, of a ſubſcription, in theſe words; <hi>Symon Peter,</hi> a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt; the ſecond, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, in theſe words; To them which haue obtained like precious faith with vs; the third is a ſalutation, in theſe words; Grace and peace be multiplied, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Symon Peter.</hi> Obſerue here the firſt thing which the Apoſtle doth in this worke; he ſets or ſubſcribes his name. And <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is an honeſt &amp; commendable practiſe in ſuch as write Bookes for the vſe of Gods Church to do the ſame:</hi> and that for theſe reaſons: firſt, to ſhew that they are readie to iuſtifie their writings: ſecondly, that they are ready, to their power, to ſatisfie any which make any ſcruple of any thing writ by them: thirdly, that they are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10122:9"/> not aſhamed of the truth deliuered.</p>
               <p>Indeed in ſome caſes Writers names are better kept cloſe then publiſhed; as firſt, if the perſons writing be ſcandalous, it is pitie that their ſcandalous names ſhould hinder the paſſage of the truth, Secondly, if the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be in no requeſt in the Church of God, it is pitie that their diſregard ſhould hinder a profitable booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this point may iuſtly be to tax a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nameleſſe railing books, ſent out by Anabaptiſts, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts, &amp; the like, which are ſo vile &amp; ſo bitter, as that the writers thereof haue ſeemed to be aſhamed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their names, as being vnable indeed to iuſtifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt. Peter</hi> was a great Apoſtle, and one that had obtained a great degree among men, and yet hee profeſſeth himſelfe but a ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt; and indeed <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>the chiefe of the creatures are but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in this reſpect. Dauid</hi> though a King, yet profeſſeth himſelfe but a ſeruant, in reſpect of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16. Yea the very Angels acknowledge themſelues to be but fellow ſeruants with vs in the ſame regard, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This makes much for the glorie of Chriſt. We may ſay of Chriſt, as it is ſaid of <hi>Melchiſedech, Heb.</hi> 7.4. How great was this man vnto whom the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> payed tithes? So, how great was this God and man, vnto whom Kings, Apoſtles, and Angels profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be but ſeruants. And this ſhould ſerue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10122:9"/> the ſcandall of the Croſſe. They that take offence at Chriſt, becauſe he dyed ſuch a baſe death, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member withall what the Scripture noteth concerning the glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This alſo ſhould teach euery Chriſtian, not to be aſhamed to profeſſe themſelues to be the ſeruants of Chriſt. We need not be aſhamed of our Maiſter, for he is a God; nor of our worke, for it is honeſt; nor of our (though vndeſerued) wages, for that is no leſſe then a kingdome; therefore let vs profeſſe without ſhame or abaſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And an Apoſtle.</hi> There were fiue orders of Miniſters appointed by Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>viz.</hi> Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Euangeliſts, Paſtours and Doctours; amongſt theſe fiue orders, the Apoſtles were the chiefe, and therefore are named in that fore-named Text before the Prophets, becauſe indeed they liued to ſee all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, which the Prophets and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt did not. Now the office of an Apoſtle was firſt to plant Churches, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant; and ſecondly, to haue eſpeciall ſway in Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.3. they were to decide controuerſies. Thirdly, to work miracles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.8. heale the ſicke, caſt out diuels, &amp;c. Fourthly, to preach to the whole world, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. and that by extraordinary reuelation, <hi>Matth</hi> 10.20. It is not yee that ſpeake, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Peter</hi> was ſuch a Miniſter, and not an ordinarie teacher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Apostle of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Here <hi>Peter</hi> doth intimate vnto the Church, that their duty was to receiue his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for he came vnto them as an Apoſtle or meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10122:10"/> from Chriſt, and did ſpeake from him.</p>
               <p>And indeed, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>vnleſſe a Miniſter ſpeake as the words of Chriſt, we are not to receiue him, nor his doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any come vnto you, &amp; bring you not this doctrine, receiue him not to houſe, ſaith the Apoſtle, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the tenth verſe.</p>
               <p>And it is ſet downe as the commendation of Gods people, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.5. that they will not follow a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but flie from him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this is, to teach vs Miniſters, that if we will haue Gods people to receiue our doctrine, then we muſt ſpeake from Chriſt, and not from our owne ſpirit: we muſt deliuer the ordinances and oracles of Chriſt, not our owne inuentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, it ſhould teach the people, as good Baere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to trie the doctrine deliuered vnto them, whether it be from Chriſt, or no. And this will appeare if they trie it by the canonicall Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To them which haue obtained.</hi> The word in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is very ſignificant, for it ſignifieth to obtaine by lot: whence we may obſerue, <hi>That grace is as a portion obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by lot:</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe, as God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of whatſoeuer is giuen by lot, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. the laſt verſe, ſo he is the author of all grace which we receiue, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. All theſe things worketh the ſame Spirit. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe, as in the deuiding of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of <hi>Canaan,</hi> there was giuen, by Gods diſpoſing, to one Tribe a greater portion, to another Tribe a leſſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 33.54. ſo to one is giuen a greater meaſure of grace, to another a leſſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe, as in that deuiding of <hi>Canaan</hi> by lot, euery Tribe receiued an inheritance, but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10122:10"/> that they muſt fight for it, and caſt out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, <hi>Numbers</hi> 33.52. ſo euery elect child of God ſhall receiue a portion of grace, but yet alwayes proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they caſt out the inhabitants, that is, the ſtrong man. For, if there be not a mortifying of the old man, there can be no putting on of the new.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſhould teach vs, not to enuy the gifts of others, though they be better then our owne; it is God which giueth both the greater gift to another, and the leſſe gift to thee: ſubmit to his wiſedome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Like precious faith.</hi> What Faith is, we will not in this place ſtand to define, purpoſing to ſpeake at large of it (if God permit) among the Grounds of Religion, by way of catechiſme, neither wil we inſiſt on the preciouſneſſe of this grace; onely that which we will obſerue, is, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That the people may attaine the like ſauing graces as are in their Miniſters.</hi> Yea in ſome particular graces the people may go beyond their Miniſters, as we ſee in <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 18.26. they out-ſtripped <hi>Apollos</hi> himſelfe in ſome things. Yea, as we ſee likewiſe in experience from time to time; how many people be there that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell many Miniſters, in patience, in tenderneſſe of heart, in almes-deeds, and the like.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe God is a free worker, he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Miniſters therefore muſt beſtirre themſelues, leſt the people out-ſtrip them. And this indeed ſhould be the ſtriuing betweene Miniſters and people, namely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend who ſhall out-ſtrip one another in grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> That is, by his fidelitie in the performance of his promiſe. Whence note, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10122:11"/>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods owne fidelitie is an eſpeciall motiue vnto God to giue grace vnto his elect.</hi> It moued him to giue the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious faith which he gaue to his Apoſtles, euen to his Church &amp; people. And what I pray you moued Chriſt to ſend downe his Spirit in the ſimilitude of clouen Tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3. but becauſe he had promiſed ſo to do? <hi>Acts</hi> 1. verſe. 5.</p>
               <p>And it muſt needs be, if God giue grace vnto any of vs, he is moued thereunto, either by ſomething in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or elſe by ſomething in vs; but there is nothing in vs naturally to moue God: therefore he muſt needes be moued intrinſicallly, or by ſomewhat in himſelfe, and that is his fidelitie and mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Therefore the way to attaine grace at Gods hand, is to vrge God with his promiſe; we muſt ſay as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.2. Deliuer me in thy righteouſneſſe. Let vs therefore get a catalogue of promiſes out of the Word, ſuch as theſe. I will poure my Spirit vpon all fleſh, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. They ſhall all be taught of God, <hi>Ieremy</hi> 31. I will giue them an heart of fleſh, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. My ſeruants ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. and then let vs flie to the fidelitie of God for the performance of theſe promiſes.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="verse">
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace.</hi> Now come we to the third part of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, which is the Salutation: and in this Salutation we are to take notice; firſt, of the things wiſhed to the Church, and they are two, to wit, grace and peace.</p>
               <p>Where by grace, we are to vnderſtand two things, <hi>viz.</hi> the fauour of God, as the ſame word is taken in <hi>Exodus</hi> 33.17. and the gift of the Spirit, as it is meant in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.9.</p>
               <p>So that the point hence to be obſerued is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That the fauour of God, and the gift of Gods Spirit, they are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10122:11"/> to be wiſhed and deſired aboue all things in the world, next to Gods glorie.</hi> The Apoſtle wiſheth theſe vnder the name of grace, as we ſee here, in the firſt place: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe things are worth the ſeeking: for firſt, as for Gods fauour, it is better then life it ſelfe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. It is the cauſe of all bleſſings which we receiue; yea, without it nothing can comfort vs. As nothing could ſatisfie <hi>Abſolon,</hi> but the kings face, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32. ſo nothing can ſatisfie a true Chriſtian, but the aſſurance of Gods fauour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for the gift of the Spirit, what can be compared vnto it? If with <hi>Symon Magus</hi> thou wouldeſt buy it with money, thy price will be ſcorned, all things are but droſſe and dung, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. in compariſon of the excellent knowledge of Chriſt. Grace is that treaſure in the field, and that Pearle, which when a man hath found, he will part with all which he hath to purchaſe it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. Yea, grace is that which will helpe in time of need, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.16. Riches will leaue vs, friends will forſake vs at the houre of death, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace will neuer forſake vs.</p>
               <p>This ſerueth iuſtly to reproue the common courſe of the world; for many will ſeeke the fauour of the Ruler, as it is in <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 29.26. but, who reſpecteth or ſeeketh the fauour of God? Gods fauor is neglected, as a thing not worthy our ſeeking, when it is the moſt excellent thing in the world. O fooles that we are, when will we be wiſe!</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it ſerue to excite vs to ſeeke Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: and that we may attaine vnto it, theſe rules are to be obſerued: firſt, we muſt be throughly humbled for ſinne with <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. Secondly, we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10122:12"/> muſt come vnto God by a Mediator, to wit, by Chriſt, as the men of <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> reconciled themſelues to <hi>Herod,</hi> hauing made <hi>Blaſtus</hi> the Kings Chamberlaine their friend, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.20. Thirdly, we muſt come vnto God with a reſolution to become his ſeruants, as the Prodigall ſonne did, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.19. Which rules if we do obſerue, the Lord will come running to meete vs; yea he will fall vpon our neckes, and kiſſe vs.</p>
               <p>Yea there is not the filthieſt adulterer, nor the moſt cut-throate vſurer, nor the moſt damnable ſwearer, but if they had grace to come vnto God after this manner, the Lord would forgiue them, though their ſinnes had bene as red as ſcarlet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Againe, this ſhould teach vs to labour for the gift of the Spirit, that is, for grace. And that we may obtaine it: firſt, we muſt get the preparation thereunto, and that is, ſelfe-deniall, and humilitie; for God giues grace to the humble, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. Secondly, we muſt plant our ſelues vnder a powerfull Miniſterie: we muſt repaire to the tents of the Shepheards, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.8. Thirdly, we muſt waite in Hieruſalem for the promiſe of the Father, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4. we muſt not ſeparate from Gods true Church. If we obſerue theſe rules; this is the way to obtaine grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And peace.</hi> Peace in Scripture is ſometimes vſed for proſperitie, as in 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.6. Peace be to thee, and peace be to thy houſe, and peace be to all that thou haſt. It is the ſpeech of <hi>Dauids</hi> meſſengers vnto <hi>Nabal,</hi> wherein they wiſh him all proſperitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Peace is vſed ſometimes in a more reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſence, and ſo it is taken for peace from enemies, as in 2. <hi>King.</hi> 20.19. where <hi>Hezekiah</hi> hearing of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Chaldeans, he makes anſwer to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10122:12"/> Is it not good that peace and truth be in my dayes? where, by peace, we are to vnderſtand peace from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Peace is put alſo for reconciliation with God, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 2. Glory to God on high, on the earth peace, that is, reconciliation with God.</p>
               <p>We do not deny, but the very outward proſperity of the Church is to be deſired, according to that in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 102.14. Thy ſeruants reioyce in her ſtones, and take pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic of her duſt: and therefore that a woe belongs vnto ſuch as labour to ruinate the proſperitie thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we do not deny, but that peace alſo from enemies is greatly to be wiſhed to the Church of God, according to that in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 74.19. Giue not the ſoule of thy Turtle doue into the hands of the multitude, &amp;c. Neither of theſe two peaces are to be excluded in this wiſh or option of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>But I take it, that in this Text, by peace we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand peace from God eſpecially.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>And this peace indeed is of all other peaces to be deſired.</hi> This is the peace which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. This is that peace which the Apoſtle doth ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſh to the Romanes, in the fifteenth of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, the thirteenth verſe, and to the Theſſalonians in 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.16. This is that peace which was bought with ſo deare a price, to wit, with the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.20. This is that peace which is the procurer of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3. Yea, this is that peace which is the cauſe of our ſaluation, and without the which we cannot be ſaued. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let vs labour for this peace aboue all. If we haue peace with God, we need not feare any aduerſe power.

               <p>Secondly, if you thinke you haue peace with God, then trie your peace, whether it be ſound or no: and the rather, becauſe where the ſtrong man armed keepes the houſe, there all his goods are in peace, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21.</p>
               <p>Now the peace of God in the hearts of the elect, doth differ from the diuels peace in the hearts of the wicked, in diuers reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the peace of God hath a ſure ground, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Symeon, Luk.</hi> 2.29.30. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as as the peace of the wicked hath no ſound foundation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the peace of God followes vpon great humiliation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.3. whereas the peace of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan doth not ſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the peace of God makes the perſon in whom it is, better towards God; it keepes his heart and minde in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. whereas the wicked are not bettered by their peace, but empaired.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe the peace of God in the hearts of the elect is ſubiect to interruption. For <hi>Zion</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her peace with God) yet hath theſe and ſuch like qualmes; The Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.14. whereas the peace of the wicked is not ſo, but is alwayes alike. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore trie our peace by theſe differences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be multiplied. Peter</hi> deſireth that grace might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the Church vnto whom he writes; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>And the ſame ſhould euery Miniſter deſire concerning his hearers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the Theſſalonians, to grow and to increaſe more and more, 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 4.1.10. And <hi>Peter</hi> concludeth his ſecond Epiſtle with this cloſe; Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:10122:13"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> And if the Miniſters ought to deſire a growth of grace in the people, then much more ought the people themſelues to deſire this growth. They ſhould with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> deſire a double portion of the Spirit, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 2.9. They ſhould, like good Theſſalonians, deſire that their faith might grow mightily, and that their loue one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another might abound. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>And that we may grow in grace, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue theſe rules. Firſt we muſt remoue theſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: we muſt beware of ſuffering ſinne to reigne in vs: we muſt beware of intangling our ſelues ouer much with the affaires of this world: we muſt carefully auoyd bad company. If we remoue not theſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, it is in vaine for vs to thinke euer to grow in grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we deſire to multiply grace, we muſt multiply vſe of meanes. We muſt heare much, we muſt pray much, and the like. <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple had many thouſand workemen, to bring it to perfection, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.2. euen ſo it is no ſmall paines which is required for the building of the temple of the holy Ghoſt in our hearts.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſtion.</note> But how may we trie, whether we grow and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in grace, or no? or whether we decreaſe and go backward?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> Theſe are ſignes of growth of grace: Firſt, if we attaine increaſe of victory in our eſpeciall corruptions, ſound mortification is ſubſtantiall growing.

               <p>Now the ſignes of growth of grace in weake Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if they grow in humiliation for ſinne, and in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to it, though they haue as yet but ſmall victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if they grow in care to auoid the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if they grow in deſire to attaine the victorie ouer corruption.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if they grow in deſire to be diſſolued, that they might be freed from this body of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the knowledge of God.</hi> Howbeit the word in the originall ſignifieth moſt properly, acknowledgement; yet it is beſt rendred in this place (as it doth alſo ſignifie) Knowledge: for the compound word is vſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſometimes as the ſimple, and in the ſame ſence, as we reade in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.4. that thou mayeſt know the word in the originall, according to the Letter, ſignifies, that thou mayeſt acknowledge; but it is better tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the ſimple word, that thou mayeſt know; and ſo in this place, in the acknowledgement of God, that is, in the knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By or in the knowledge of God.</hi> By knowledge, is not meant a bare literall knowledge, as to know that there is a God, or, that there is a Chriſt, and that this Chriſt is Lord of all, and the like: but we are to vnderſtand it of a ſpirituall and ſpeciall knowledge. And to the end that we may the more diſtinctly conceiue what is meant
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10122:14"/> by the ſpeciall or ſauing knowledge of God; I will lay downe certaine differences betweene that kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which is meerely literall, and that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is ſpirituall and ſauing.</p>
               <p>And the firſt difference is; this ſauing knowledge of God, is knowledge ioyned with ſauing faith, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. I know whom I haue beleeued: Knowledge and Faith went together. But li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall knowledge is a bare notion in the braine, without faith in the heart; for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, All men haue not faith. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſauing knowledge of God, is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, it altereth the perſons in whom it is to the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of it, euen as a ſeale leaueth its print vpon the waxe. Thus we reade 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe, the glory of the Lord, are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſame image, from glory to glory, euen as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> It is not ſo with bare literall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; it delighteth the ſubiect, but it changeth him not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſauing knowledge is experimentall. Gods children know Chriſt, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his afflictions, and are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable vnto his death, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.10. They feele that which they know: but it is not ſo with them which haue a meere literall knowledge: theſe may talke of faith and regeneration, and the like, but they feele it not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſauing knowledge of God, is ioyned with obedience to Gods commandements, as appeares in 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.3.4. <hi>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandements. He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandements, is a lier, and the truth is not in him.</hi> But bare literall knowledge is not ioyned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10122:15"/> with ſound practiſe: it can furniſh a man with talke, and vaine glorious words, but it leaues him ſhort in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: it can ſay well, but it cannot do well; it can frame a forme of godlineſſe, but it denieth the power, 2. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, true ſauing knowledge is ioyned with the fruits of good workes, as appeareth in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Which is come vnto you as it is in all the world, and bringeth foorth fruit, as it doth alſo in you, ſince the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth.</hi> Whereas bare literall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is alwayes barren, it is like to the curſed figge tree, it hath leaues, but it beares no fruit.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, true ſauing knowledge is ioyned with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it maketh a man or woman more humble, according to that in <hi>Eccleſiast.</hi> 1.18. <hi>For in much wiſedome is much griefe, and he that increaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow.</hi> Whereas bare literall knowledge, it puffeth vp, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh in 1. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 8.1. Where haue you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which haue knowledge without grace, but they are puffed vp like a bladder with the very conceit of it?</p>
               <p>Let vs examine our knowledge by theſe ſixe rules, and it will eaſily appeare, whether it be ſauing or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, whether it be ſpirituall or literall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the knowledge of God.</hi> Hence we are to learne, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That the way to grow in ſenſe &amp; feeling of Gods fauor, to grow in grace, in peace of conſcience; yea the way to attaine victory againſt enemies and other temporall bleſsings, it is to get ſauing knowledge.</hi> This is manifeſt, becauſe the Apoſtle wiſheth here grace and peace to be multiplied by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>And how came <hi>Paul</hi> to be rapt vp into the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? 2. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 12.4. or <hi>Iohn</hi> to be rauiſhed in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10122:15"/> Spirit? <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 1. but becauſe reuelations of knowledge were giuen vnto them; their plentie of knowledge wrought in them a wonderfull degree of the ſenſe and feeling of Gods fauour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how came Chriſtians to vnderſtand the feare of the Lord, iudgement, and righteouſneſſe, and equitie, and euery good path, but by knowledge? <hi>Prou.</hi> 2.3.4.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whoſe wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſſe, and whoſe paths are paths of peace, but the wayes and paths of knowledge? <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, how came that little Citie which had few men in it, to be deliuered from the great King which came againſt it, but by wiſedome? <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.15.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, how came <hi>Solomon</hi> to be ſo incomparably rich, and honourable in the world, was it not becauſe he asked wiſedome in the firſt place? 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.12.13.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the doctrine propounded, to be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proued in the ſeuerall branches of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> And it ſerues firſt to ſhew vnto vs a maine reaſon, wherefore ſo many complaine of the want of peace of conſcience, and of their not profiting in grace, and of their not beholding Gods fauourable countenance, and the like. It is becauſe they do not grow and increaſe in ſauing knowledge: for if they grew in knowledge, they ſhould alſo grow in all other graces. Knowledge is the firſt wheele in this clocke, it moueth all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhould ſerue to ſtir vs vp to the ſtudy of ſauing knowledge. Get we knowledge, and all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will follow. And the rules to be obſerued for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of knowledge, are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt ſeeke it of God, by earneſt praiet. So
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10122:16"/> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prouerbs</hi> 2.3. <hi>If thou cry for knowledge, and lift vp thy voyce for vnderſtanding, then thou ſhalt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the feare of the Lord, and ſhalt finde the knowledge of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt take great paines in ſeeking of it, and in digging for it in the mines of Gods ordinances, according to the Wiſe mans direction, <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 2.4. <hi>If thou ſearcheſt for her as for ſiluer, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt practiſe that which we know alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And this is the way to obtaine more knowledge, according to that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt walke with the wiſe, that is, we muſt company with ſuch as feare God, and by this means we ſhall be made more wiſe. <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 13.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And of Ieſus.</hi> This name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> it ſignifies a Sauiour: it is a name which was giuen vnto Chriſt before he was conceiued in the wombe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.2. And the reaſon why it was giuen vnto him, is yeelded in <hi>Mathew</hi> 1.21. Thou ſhalt call his name Ieſus: for he ſhall ſaue his people from their ſinnes. But to come to the doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſus.</hi> In that Chriſt is here named Ieſus, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a Sauiour, hence we are to note, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That he alone is the meritorious Sauiour.</hi> This is manifeſt out of <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11. where it is ſaid: <hi>This is the ſtone which was ſet at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, neither is there ſaluation in any other, &amp;c.</hi> And like vnto this is that alſo in 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.11.12. <hi>And this is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that God hath giuen vnto vs eternall life, and this life is in his Sonne, he that hath the Sonne, hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne of God, hath not life.</hi> By which Texts it is manifeſt, that Chriſt is the onely meritorious
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10122:16"/> Sauiour. There was neuer any other Sauiour preached to the world by the Prophets and Apoſtles, neither was there euer any other Sauiour beleeued on in the world by the true Church. 1. <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Therefore this ſerues to confute that popiſh antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine, concerning merit of workes: for if Chriſt be the onely Ieſus our Sauiour, then our owne workes are not our ſauiours. What is more manifeſt? Where note by the way, we do not here ſpeake againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good workes, or preach an exemption from good workes, though we thus ſpeake; we rather exhort men vnto them by all our power: but that which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and preach againſt, is the putting confidence in the merit of workes. Therefore let not the Papiſts ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the doctrine of our Church, as though it were an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the very practiſe of good workes. It is not an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of charity, but a true friend vnto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, if Chriſt be the onely Sauiour, then let vs truſt in him alone. Our Fathers truſted in him, and were not confounded, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 22.5. Yea, if Gods wrath be kindled but a little, bleſſed are all that truſt in Chriſt, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2.12. Let vs not truſt in our owne works; Chriſt is ſufficiently able of himſelfe to ſaue them which come vnto God by him, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 7.25. And he is as willing as able; he intreateth vs to be reconciled to God, 2. <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> 5.20. Chriſt is like an indulgent nurſe, and we are like vnto froward children; the nurſe would kiſſe vs and be friends, but we hang backe and reſiſt. But let vs kiſſe the Sonne leſt he be angry, and we periſh from the right way, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This doctrine may alſo teach vs, how to vnderſtand thoſe words in <hi>Reuelation</hi> 3.4. <hi>Theſe ſhall walke with me
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10122:17"/> in white, for they are worthy.</hi> It is not meant, that any man is worthy of heauen, by any merit in himſelfe, but by the worthineſſe of Chriſt: it is not meant of our dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, but of Gods dignation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence we may learne, how aright to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that place in <hi>Iames</hi> 2. that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified by workes. It is not meant that he was iuſtified before God by workes; for a man is iuſtified before God by faith, without the workes of the law, <hi>Romans</hi> 3.28. but it is meant, that he was iuſtified before men by workes; or, his faith was manifeſted to be a true liuing faith, by the fruits thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hence we may note, that that place in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 22.12. <hi>He will giue to euery man according as his workes ſhall be</hi> is not meant of merit. It is one thing to receiue according to our workes, and another, to receiue for the merit of our workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Lord.</hi> Whence obſerue we, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>vnto whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Chriſt is a Sauiour, to them he will be a Lord.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer will not be ruled by Chriſt, they ſhall neuer be ſaued by him. Chriſt being conſecrated, became the author of ſaluation to them which obey him, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 5.9. Whom Chriſt redeemeth, they follow him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoeuer he goeth, <hi>Reuelation</hi> 14.4. Chriſt is Prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of <hi>Melchiſedech, Pſalme</hi> 110.4. that is, King and Prieſt; to ſignifie, that vnto whom he is a Prieſt to offer Sacrifice for, to them he is a King, to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them. It is ſaid aſwell, Behold thy King cometh vnto thee, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 9.9. as, Behold, the deliuerer ſhall come, <hi>Romans</hi> 11.26. In this reſpect Chriſt is like vnto <hi>Iephta, Iudges</hi> 11.9. For as <hi>Iephta</hi> would not deliuer the Giliadites out of the hands of their enemies, but vpon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10122:17"/> condition, that he might be made their head: euen ſo, no more will Chriſt deliuer vs ſpiritually, but vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he may be our head and chiefe gouernour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſheweth how horribly they deceiue themſelues, which expect ſaluation by Chriſt, and yet liue in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt him, and crie in their hearts; We will not haue this man to rule ouer vs. But let ſuch men remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when Chriſt ſhall come, he ſhal call for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which would not haue him to rule ouer them, and will ſlay them publiquely in ſtead of ſauing of them. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, let this teach vs to ſubmit our ſelues to Chriſt, to be ruled by him. And the rather, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſeruice is an honourable ſeruice: what ſeruice to the ſeruice of a King? Secondly, becauſe it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſeruice: what Potentate is able to do that for his ſeruants, which Chriſt is able to do for his? Thirdly, becauſe it is an eaſie ſeruice: for howbeit great paines is to be taken in this ſeruice, yet we muſt remember, this great paines by Chriſt is made eaſie vnto vs. Chriſt his yoake is eaſie, and his burden is light.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let vs in the laſt place trie our ſelues, whether Chriſt rule ouer vs or no; that ſo we may trie, whether we ſhall be ſaued by him or no, and the trials briefly are theſe: Firſt, if we feare to offend his godly will; for thus ſaith God: If I be a Maiſter, where is my feare? <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.6. Secondly, it is a ſigne that we are Chriſts ſeruants, if he hath bored our eares, that is, if he hath giuen vs a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified care, to heare the word profitably, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 15.17. Thirdly, it is a ſigne that Chriſt rules ouer vs, if we obey, for it is in vaine to call him, Lord, Lord, and not to do the things which he ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.46.</p>

                  <hi>According as his diuine power, &amp;c.</hi> Now come we from the Preface to the ſubiect-matter of the Epiſtle, which is three-fold; Firſt exhortatory, in this firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, propheticall, in the third chapter; for therein is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the laſt iudgement, and the manner of it. Before the Apoſtle come to his matter of exhortation, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth in the fift verſe, he firſt prefixeth an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement tending to Gods glorie, and the comfort of the Church, vnto whom he writes in the third and fourth verſes: in which acknowledgement, two things are to be noted: firſt, a cauſe, in the third verſe: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an effect, in the fourth verſe. For the former, we are to note; firſt, the power of the giuer, <hi>according to his diuine power.</hi> Secondly, the bountifulneſſe of the gift; <hi>all things which belong to life and godlineſſe.</hi> Thirdly, the meanes of obtaining this gift, by the knowledge of him who hath called vs vnto glory and vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to his diuine power.</hi> This is ſpoken of Chriſt, and hath relation to the end of the former verſe. Whence we are to note, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That Ieſus hath in him, not an humane power onely, but alſo a diuine, not the power of a man onely, but alſo the power of a God.</hi> For this cauſe he is termed in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 9.6, <hi>The mighty God.</hi> And in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13 <hi>The great God.</hi> For this cauſe is made mention of his mighty power, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. the laſt: Yea for this cauſe he is ſaid to haue <hi>all power, both in heauen, and in earth. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> 28.18.</p>
               <p>And it is further manifeſt, that Chriſt had diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; Firſt, becauſe he was able to create the world, <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:10122:18"/> 1.3. Secondly, becauſe he is able with his word, to beare vp the world, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. Thirdly, becauſe he knowes the thoughts of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.4. Fourthly, becauſe he wrought miracles by his owne power, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.24. Fiftly, becauſe he vanquiſhed Satan, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2.14. diſſolued ſinne: 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. and ouercame the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.33. which workes he could neuer haue turned his hand to, if he had not had a diuine power.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This makes againſt Arrians and other curſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, which diſable Chriſt, affirming him to be meere man, and not God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it makes alſo againſt the blaſphemous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, which ſubiect Chriſt to the command of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Marie,</hi> derogating thereby from his diuine power.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may be terrour to the wicked, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Antichriſt: for it ſheweth how able Chriſt is to conſume him with the ſpirit of his mouth, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him with the brightneſſe of his coming, 2. <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it may miniſter comfort to the faithfull: for, be their dangers neuer ſo deſperate, and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies neuer ſo malicious, yet Chriſt by his diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, is able to deliuer them, and to protect them. If a finite power be againſt them, yet an infinite power is for them, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.7.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All things which pertaine to life, and &amp;c.</hi> Whence note we, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That whatſoeuer tendeth to ſaluation or ſanctification, we receiue it all from Chriſt.</hi> For by life here is meant, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and by godlineſſe is meant vertue, as it is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the end of the verſe.</p>
               <p>The doctrine may be proued by inſtance. For, from whom haue we the Goſpel, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt? The Goſpel
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10122:19"/> of the kingdome is Chriſts Goſpel, as it is termed 2. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 10.14. And God ſpeakes vnto his Church in theſe laſt dayes by his Sonne, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 1.1. Againe, from whom receiue we the Spirit, but from Chriſt? <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.7. Thirdly, whence receiue we gifts of the Spirit, but from Chriſt which aſcended vp on high? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. that he might giue gifts to men. Of whoſe fulneſſe do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue grace for grace, but of Chriſts fulneſſe? <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. Laſtly, how are we kept in the ſtate of grace vnto glory, but by Chriſt, who is the Shepheard and Biſhop of our ſoules? 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whence are the Sacraments but from Chriſt? He ordained Baptiſme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. He alſo inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Lords Supper, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.26. Laſtly, who is it that ſends Miniſters, but the ſame Chriſt, which gaue ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Euangeliſts, &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>So that it is apparent by inſtance, that whatſoeuer tendeth to ſaluation or ſanctification, it is from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Yea but do we not receiue theſe things, as well from God the Father, and from God the holy Ghoſt, as from Chriſt? I anſwer, Yes. Farre be it from vs to exclude the Father, or the holy Ghoſt. But this we affirme, that as all things pertaining to life and godlineſſe, are of the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, ſo they are alſo from Chriſt. For, as the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo he hath giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himſelfe. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this point may be to teach vs to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Chriſt; for by his meanes we receiue life, and all things tending thereunto. Yea it ſhould teach vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon Chriſt, for life, and for all the meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10122:19"/> Of his diuine power we receiue all things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to life and godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach vs to take notice of Chriſts bounty. He giues life and all things that belong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. He is the good Shepheard, in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 23. which ſupplieth all things neceſſary to his flocke. Chriſts flocke may want many things which they deſire, but they ſhall neuer want thoſe things which ſhall be good for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hath giuen vnto vs.</hi> The word in the originall is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, and ſignifieth, hath bene giuen: but we muſt know, that with the Greekes, the paſſiue voice is ſometimes put for the actiue. An example for this we haue. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.26. where you haue it tranſlated, hath promiſed; but it properly ſignifieth, hath bene promiſed: the paſſiue voice being put for the actiue.</p>
               <p>But the doctrine hence is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That whatſoeuer pertaineth to life and godlineſſe, it is not of merit, but of free gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saluation is the free gift of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. the laſt. The Goſpell is the word of grace, that is, of free fauour, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. To you it is giuen to know the myſteries of the Kingdome of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.10. <hi>Paul</hi> obtained mercie, not merit, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. By all which it is manifeſt, that ſaluation and all the means thereof, is of free gift: and ſo by vs is to be accounted. But we will not inſiſt vpon this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Life.</hi> Hence we are to note, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is a life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the elect after this life ended.</hi> And that this is ſo, it is manifeſt out of <hi>Pſalme</hi> 21.4. He asked life of thee, and thou gaueſt him a long life, for euer and euer. And <hi>Pſalme</hi> 133. For there the Lord commanded the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, euen life for euer. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46. And they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10122:20"/> ſhall go away into euerlaſting puniſhment; but the righteous into life eternall. Vnto this alſo accordeth that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.25. Ieſus ſaid vnto her, I am the reſurrection and the life, he that beleeueth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he liue. And that in <hi>Matthew.</hi> 22.32. I am the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iacob:</hi> God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing. And that in <hi>Colloſſ.</hi> 3.3. You are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God. By all which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies it is proued, that there is a life prepared for Gods elect, after this life ended.</p>
               <p>Now if you deſire to know what kinde of life it is which is prepared, I confeſſe I am not able to expreſſe it, if I had the tongues of men and Angels: but theſe things are noted in generall in holy Scripture concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it. Firſt, that it is not a diſſolute, but an holy life: and for this cauſe heauen is called an holy place, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.12. and Gods holy habitation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not a miſerable, but a bleſſed life: For bleſſed are they which ſhall be called to the marriage Supper of the Lambe, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19.9. and bleſſed are they which die in the Lord, &amp;c. In this life ſhal be no ſorrow, for all teares ſhall be wiped away. In this life ſhall be no want, for we ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt no more, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 7.16.17. In this life we ſhall be happy, in reſpect of our company, for we ſhall euer be with the Lord, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.14. Yea, we ſhall come to the company of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Angels, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.22. and ſhall ſit downe with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the kingdome of heauen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it is not a diſquietous, but a peaceable life; and in this reſpect it is called a reſt in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. There
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10122:20"/> remained therefore a reſt to the people of God. Here Gods children ſhall reſt from their labours, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 14.13. Here they reſt from their troubles and moleſtations, <hi>Iob</hi> 3.17.18. Yea, here they ſhall reſt from their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For he that is dead is freed from ſinne, <hi>Romans</hi> 6.7. and ſo by conſequence, from all occaſions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, it is an eternall life which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, as appeares by that ſpeech of Chriſt himſelfe in <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.28. And I giue vnto them eternall life. And by that of the Apoſtle in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. where this life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeake, is termed an inheritance incorruptible, and vndefiled, that fadeth not away, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The application of this point may ſerue; firſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the curſed opinion of Atheiſts, which impugne and gaine-ſay (eſpecially in their hearts) the truth of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Theſe are like vnto blinde men, which ſay there is neither Sunne, Moone, nor Starres in the firmament, becauſe they ſee none, not conſidering what others ſee and know.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, this ſhould moue vs to be thankfull to God for this his infinite mercie toward vs, in that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided thus for vs for time to come: we ſhall not droppe downe like dogges and bruite beaſts, but we ſhall liue for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Thirdly, it ſhould teach vs to labour to attaine this life. And that we may do ſo, we muſt obſerue theſe rules; firſt, we muſt learne to know God and Chriſt aright. For this is life eternall, to know God, and whom he hath ſent, Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. Secondly, we muſt heare Gods word with diligence: for God hath ſaid; Heare, and your ſoule ſhall liue, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.3. Thirdly, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10122:21"/> for the iuſt ſhall liue by faith, that is, ſhall obtaine eternall life by faith, <hi>Romans</hi> 1.17. For of that life the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſpeaketh in that place. Fourthly, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to keepe the Commandements, <hi>Mathew</hi> 19.17. Fiftly, if we would receiue the crowne of life, we muſt be faithfull to the death, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.10. Thus much for this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And godlineſſe.</hi> The word in the originall ſignifieth the right worſhip of God, part being put for the whole. But certainely, by godlineſſe, we are to vnderſtand the ſame as is vnderſtood by Vertue in the words following, to wit, all grace and goodneſſe; but eſpecially, holineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> Now concerning this grace, firſt let vs obſerue the motiues which ſhould moue vs to labour for it, and they are theſe: firſt, becauſe we are commanded of God to labour for it, as in 1. <hi>Timothy</hi> 6.11. But thou a man of God, flie theſe things, and follow after righteouſneſſe, godlineſſe, faith, loue, patience, meekneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it is a ſigne of election, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 4.3. But know, that God hath choſen to himſelf a godly man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe it is profitable for all things, and hath the promiſes of this life preſent, and of that which is to come, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe it is great gaine, being ioyned with contentment, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6.</p>
               <p>Now the means to attaine godlineſſe, are theſe: firſt, we muſt haue a care to keep the Sabbath day holy. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe vpon the Sabbath, is the cauſe of profaneneſſe all the weeke after.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt be carefull of priuate duties, as of prayer, reading, meditating, and the like; and that euery day in the weeke.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:10122:21"/>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt conuerſe with ſuch as are godlie. Much increaſe of godlineſſe is obtained by Chriſtian ſocietie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt be content to part with our ſinnes; yea our eſpeciall ſinnes reigning: ſinnes and godlineſſe can neuer ſtand together.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we muſt be practiſers of the will of God, and not hearers onely. Practiſe is the very life of godlineſſe. 2. <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if any deſire to trie themſelues, whether they be godly or no, let them examine themſelues by the fiue fore-named rules: for the practiſe or not practiſe of the rules, is a ſigne, either of our godlineſſe, or profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. By them it will appeare what we are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the knowledge of him.</hi> What it is to know God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we heard before: and how knowledge is the means of increaſe in grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which hath called vs vnto glory &amp; vertue.</hi> Some reade the words thus; which hath called vs by glory and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; vnderſtanding by glorie and vertue, the glorious and vertuous worke of God himſelfe, in the conuerting and ſauing of a ſinner. And howſoeuer this ſence might ſtand well with the conſtruction of the Greeke Text, yet it doth not well agree to the ſcope of the holie Ghoſt. For the ſcope is not to ſhew, by what we are called, but, vnto what we are called: ſo that I embrace this reading, <hi>who hath called vs to glorie and vertue.</hi> And if any ſhall obiect, that the word in the originall ſignifieth by glory and vertue, I anſwer, the word originall may ſignifie, by, or to: as the ſame word is vſed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. where it is ſaid, that Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, by the glorie of the Father: or, as it may be better rendred, to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10122:22"/> the glorie of God the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which hath called vs vnto glorie and vertue.</hi> Where from the coniunction of theſe two together, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>that glorie and vertue are twinnes, which go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one cannot be had without the other.</hi> He that will attaine glorie, muſt haue vertue; and he that hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained true vertue, he ſhall be ſure to obtaine glorie. For the proofe hereof I referre you to that in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 84.11. For the Lord God is a Sunne and ſhield: the Lord will giue grace and glory. Where note, that the Lord giues not grace without glorie, nor glory without grace: but vnto whom he imparts the one, to them alſo he giues the other. The like we reade in <hi>Acts</hi> 28.32. And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you vp, and to giue you an inheritance amongſt all them which are ſanctified. Where we muſt alſo note, vnto whom this heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of glorie is giuen; namely, to ſuch as are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, or to ſuch as haue vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which ſheweth how farre they are deceiued, which thinke to attaine glorie without vertue. But let ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, God hath ioyned theſe two together; they muſt take both, or refuſe both. Yea, let them ſeriouſly conſider that in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12.14. That without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, it may ſerue for the comfort of the godly. Let them aſſure themſelues, that the ſame God which hath giuen them vertue, will alſo giue them glorie. Theſe two, vertue and glorie ſhall neuer be ſeparated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Called.</hi> Whence note, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That no man may vſurpe glory and vertue:</hi> None can attaine vnto them, but he that is called vnto them by God. The Corinthians did not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10122:22"/> ſanctitie, but they were called to be Saints, 1. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> 1.2. And the <hi>Theſſallonians</hi> did not vſurpe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, but they were called to Gods Kingdome, and glorie. 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>Yea, for the attaining of glory and vertue, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, not an outward calling onely, but an inward, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that effectuall calling, whereby we are tranſlated out of darkneſſe into his maruellous light. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And the reaſon is manifeſt, to wit, becauſe grace and glorie, they cannot be attained by humane power, as is cleare out of <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. Many ſhall ſeeke to enter, and ſhal not be able: therfore theſe things cannot be vſurped.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Now, if any ſhall obiect, that in the dayes of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> the violent tooke the kingdome by force, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. my anſwer is, That violence doth not neceſſarily imply vſurpation; a man may be violent in his calling, as <hi>Iacob</hi> was in his wraſtling with God, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 32. The violent took the kingdome by force, but they were ſuch as were called to the kingdome. The Iſraelites tooke the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by force; but they had a calling ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of the point is; Firſt, to ſhew the neceſſitie of effectuall calling. Vnleſſe we be firſt effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we can neither attaine glorie nor vertue. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſheweth what a bleſſed thing it is to be truly called. If we be called effectually, we may lay hold both of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and vertue without vſurpation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Called to glory and vertue.</hi> Whence we may note, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>that the calling of a Chriſtian is an honourable calling:</hi> they are called to glory and vertue. For this cauſe the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle nameth it an high calling in <hi>Philipp.</hi> 3.14.</p>
               <p>And in eed it muſt needs be an high calling; firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10122:23"/> thereby we are called to be the children of God. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thereby we are called to the fellowſhip of Chriſt. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, therby we are called to be Kings and Prieſts. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, thereby we are called to be Saints here. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.2.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, thereby we are called to be heires of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable ioyes of heauen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</p>
               <p>And therefore the calling of a Chriſtian, is the moſt honourable calling in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which ſerueth to manifeſt the follie of ſuch which deſpiſe ſanctified Chriſtians. Many proud worldlings are lifted vp, and exalt themſelues aboue poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, becauſe they haue borne all offices which ſome Chriſtians haue not. But vnderſtand ye vnwiſe amongſt the people; the pooreſt Chriſtian hath a more honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calling then your ſelues. You haue borne office on the earth, but a true Chriſtian is ſet in heauenly places in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. His calling is worth ten thouſand of yours; yea indeed yours is not worthie to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſhould be a motiue vnto all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to walke worthie this holie calling, as the Apoſtle alſo exhorteth, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.12. Otherwiſe, it were better that a mill-ſtone were hanged about our neckes, and that we were caſt into the bottome of the Sea, then that we ſhould pollute this holie calling.</p>

            <div n="4" type="verse">
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereby.</hi> Some render it, in as much: but I rather ſubſcribe vnto their iudgement which reade the Text thus, whereby, or by which things; for they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10122:23"/> to the beginning of the former verſe, where it is ſaid, that Chriſt by his diuine power hath giuen vnto vs all things which belong to life and godlineſſe: by which gift of all things, or by which all things giuen, moſt great and precious promiſes are alſo giuen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt great and precious promiſes.</hi> Whence obſerue we, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>the promiſes of God are highly to be eſteemed, they are to be accounted great, yea moſt great and precious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that firſt, becauſe they are the promiſes of a King, yea of the King of kings; and therefore to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed for their author.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they are of infallible truth. Gods promiſes are not as the promiſes of many men, that is, yea and nay, but they are all, Yea, and Amen, 2. <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.20. and therefore to be reſpected for their truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe they are the deeds and ſhewings of a Chriſtian for his ſaluation, and for all other good things. For, what haue any of vs to ſhew, whereby we may challenge heauen, and remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſuch like priuiledges, but only Gods promiſes entitling vs thereunto? Therefore, as a man maketh great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his deeds and euidences, ſo muſt we of Gods promiſes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Gods promiſes haue excellent effects: they make vs partakers of the diuine nature, as we ſhall heare afterwards, if God aſſiſt. Secondly, they comfort them which are caſt downe. Thirdly, they eſtabliſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them which ſtand. And therefore they are highly to be eſteemed.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Gods promiſes ſhall ſtand when heauen and earth ſhall be remoued. For heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my words ſhal not paſſe away. So ſaith Chriſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10122:24"/> 
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> 24.35. Wherefore it followeth by ſufficient reaſon, that the diuine promiſes are to be reſpected for their ſtabilitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Not to inſiſt vpon any more arguments for the proofe of the point, the vſes which we may make of it, are theſe: Firſt, it ſerueth iuſtly to condemne all atheiſts and incredulous people, which reſpect not the promiſes of God. If a great man, or a friend ingage himſelfe by promiſe vnto them, they make great account of ſuch a promiſe; but as for the promiſes of God, they eſteeme them light. O curſed infidels! is the promiſe of a man precious, and is not the promiſe of a God infinitely more precious? Doeſt thou beleeue the creature, and not the Creator? But to let theſe paſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may alſo ſerue to reproue many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which eſteeme too lightly of Gods promiſes, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from them, as though they were little worth. Conſider with thy ſelfe; ſuppoſe that a King ſhould free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer vnto his ſubiect a great gift, or ſhould freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him ſuch or ſuch a fauour; would we not account him fooliſh which would refuſe the Kings offer, and make light of it? Beloued, this is thy caſe: God doth freely offer to binde himſelfe by promiſe vnto thee, and thou refuſeſt to take his word and offer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt examine, whether the promiſes of God be moſt great and precious or no with vs. And that will appeare: firſt, by our zeale, and forwardneſſe to heare Gods word: if we eſteeme it precious, ſure we wil preaſe vnto it. Secondly, by our thankefulneſſe for it. Thirdly, by our care to keepe it ſafe. Fourthly, by our ioy in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are giuen.</hi> Some reade it thus; He hath giuen: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10122:24"/> the paſſiue verbe in the actiue ſignification, as the participle of the ſame word was taken actiuely in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe. Whether we take it actiuely or paſſiuely, it is not much materiall: the doctrine which will follow from either reading is this, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That Gods promiſes, though they be moſt great and precious, yet they are of free gift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What moued God to make that precious promiſe to <hi>Adam;</hi> the Seed of the woman ſhall breake the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3. but his owne free grace? What moued Chriſt to ſay to the thiefe on the croſſe, To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. but his owne compaſſion? What cauſed the Lord to ſay vnto <hi>Abraham;</hi> In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 22.18. but his owne goodneſſe? The like may be ſaid concerning the promiſe of ſending of the Comforter, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.7. and concerning ſpirituall protection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.21. and concerning Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning at the laſt day to receiue vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.3. The like may be ſaid of the promiſes made to Iſraell concerning their returne out of <hi>Egipt</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> In a word, the like may be ſayd of all Gods promiſes made to his Church; from time to time they were all of free grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Now if any ſhall obiect, that God was moued to promiſe riches vnto <hi>Solomon,</hi> by the wiſe choiſe of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> himſelfe, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 3.12.13. and therefore that his promiſe is not alwayes free.</p>
               <p>To ſuch I anſwer, That the Lord gaue the power to <hi>Solomon</hi> to make that choice, ſo that God is the cauſe of the cauſe. For if the Lord moue vs to do good, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vs thereunto, and then make a gracious promiſe vnto vs for our obedience; it is manifeſt that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of ſuch a promiſe, is meerely of grace, becauſe he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10122:25"/> of his mercie enableth vs to do that, for the which he is moued to make a promiſe vnto vs, and that by the ſame mercie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> As this makes againſt merit-mongers, which aſcribe ſo much to their deſerts: ſo it ſerues to ſet forth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God. He makes moſt great and precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, freely, and for nothing. If men make promiſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly their promiſes are mercenarie, but Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are free.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, it may ſerue to encourage all ſuch as are touched with the ſenſe and feeling of their owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, to ſtirre vp themſelues, to take hold on Gods promiſes. They are free, they are of gift, they go not by deſert, therefore receiue them as a free gift offred to an vnworthy perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That by them ye might be partakers of his diuine nature.</hi> By diuine nature here is not meant the very eſſence of God: for is impoſſible that the Lord ſhould dwell eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially in ſo narrow a compaſſe as our hearts, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the heauens, and the heauens of heauens are not able to containe him. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.6. But we are to vnderſtand by diuine nature, the image of God, or true ſauing grace, which is called the diuine nature: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is begotten of God in the elect, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.13. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe it is like vnto him, as being indeed his owne image, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The diuine nature.</hi> Hence we are to obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace comes the nearest of all other things to the nature of God himſelfe.</hi> It is called here the diuine nature it ſelfe, from the neare likeneſſe which it hath vnto it. So in like manner it is ſometime termed God, as in 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.15. God dwelleth in him, that is, ſauing grace. Sometimes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10122:25"/> it is called Chriſt, as in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.27. Chriſt in you the hope of glorie, that is, grace in you. Sometimes alſo it is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the holy Ghoſt, as in 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.19. Know you not that your body is the temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you; that is, of grace which is in you. Now why is grace called God, and Chriſt, and holy Ghoſt, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of that liuely reſemblance which it hath of God, of Chriſt, and of the holy Ghoſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeed ſauing grace may truly be ſaid to come the neareſt to the nature of God. Firſt, becauſe it is the moſt excellent thing in the world, according to that in <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 4.7. Wiſedome is the chiefe thing. Secondly, becauſe it is the moſt pure thing in the world, more pure then alabaſter, then gold, yea then the heauens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Thirdly, becauſe it is the moſt powerfull thing in the world, next vnto God himſelfe: it is able to make of a Wolfe, a Lambe, as we ſee in <hi>Paul.</hi> It is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the world: for this is the victorie which ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the world, euen our faith, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4. Yea it is able to quench all the fierie darts of the wicked one, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. Laſtly, it is able to helpe in time of need, when all the world cannot helpe, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.16. Therefore grace comes the neareſt to the nature of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which ſerues to deſcrie the follie of Papiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idolaters, which thinke to reſemble God in bodily ſhapes, as though a dumbe idoll were the neareſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to Gods nature. But let ſuch idiots remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that not ſtone, or wood, or gold, but grace and vertue, come the neareſt to Gods image.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, we may here take notice, that the diuell was a lier from the beginning, in that he would make our firſt parents beleeue, that the way to become like to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10122:26"/> God, was to violate and breake Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3.5. whereas indeed the way to be like God, is to take the quite contrary courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Thirdly, this ſheweth that the ſinne of ſuch which ſcoffe at grace and perſecute it, is very fearefull; for in this they ſcoffe at and perſecute the diuine nature: but let ſuch remember the practiſe of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him for the like ſinne, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 21.9.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Fourthly, this ſhould teach vs to eſteeme of Gods children, which are indued with this diuine nature; and we muſt labour for the ſame image, which we ſee in them: it is worth the labouring for, it is no leſſe then the diuine nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereby.</hi> Whence obſerue we, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The word, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Goſpel and the promiſes, are the meanes to beget this diuine nature of ſauing grace in the hearts of the elect.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Iames</hi> in his firſt chapter &amp; eighteenth verſe; Of his owne will begat he vs by the word of truth. Thus ſaith alſo <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, the firſt chapter, and three and twentith verſe; We are borne againe, not of mortall ſeed, but of immortall by the word of God. I do not deny but that the Spirit may be receiued by the faithfull preaching of any part of canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but yet it is alſo true, that moſt vſually the Spirit is conueyed by the preaching of the Goſpell; in which reſpect alſo the Goſpell is called the miniſtration of the Spirit, 2. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 3.8. Not onely becauſe it is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall doctrine, but alſo becauſe the Spirit of God is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This condemnes the perſecuters of the Goſpell: for they are enemies to that which is the means of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good vnto Gods Church. For, take away the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10122:26"/> and how ſhall we euer come to be partakers of the diuine nature?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, this ſhould teach vs to be thankfull for the Goſpell, conſidering vnto what an excellent purpoſe it is giuen, <hi>viz.</hi> that by it we might be made partakers of the diuine nature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if euer we meane to be partaker of the diuine nature, we muſt diligently heare Chriſts Goſpell, and carefully meditate therein day &amp; night. We muſt make high account of the promiſes; for by them we come to be partakers of the diuine nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The corruptions in the world.</hi> By corruptions we are to vnderſtand the corrupt dealings in the world; the which corrupt dealings are fitly termed corruptions or putrifactions, becauſe they come from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction of the fleſh, and that for want of the ſalt of grace. And the doctrine hence to be obſerued, is, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That in the world there be great corruptions.</hi> There be, and haue bene corruptions in all ſorts of men from time to time; in Magiſtrates, as <hi>Pſalme</hi> 94.20. <hi>Shall the throne of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie haue fellowſhip with thee, which frameth miſchiefe by a Law?</hi> In Miniſters, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. <hi>All ſeeke their owne things, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſts.</hi> In tradeſmen, as <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.7. <hi>He is a merchant, the ballances of deceit are in his hand, he loueth to oppreſſe.</hi> In congregations and meetings, as <hi>Pſalme</hi> 58.1. <hi>Do yee indeed ſpeake righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, O congregation? Do yee iudge vprightly, O yee ſonnes of men? yea in heart you worke wickedneſſe, and weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</hi> Yea in all men, as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> 6.11. <hi>The earth alſo was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as there be corruptions in all ſorts of men, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10122:27"/> in all things there is much corrupt dealing. Do we not ſee groſſe ſinnes to paſſe vnpuniſhed? Do we not ſee things too much to be ruled by bribes or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour? Do we not ſee the liuings of Miniſters to be impropriated, and giuen to them which feed not the flocke? Do we not ſee Church-ſtockes, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be for the poore, to be vſed eſpecially at the humours, and for the eaſing of the rich? Do we not ſee many things paſſe for currant which are vnſound, vnder colour of cuſtome? Is not cuſtome at theſe daies (though neuer ſo corrupt) pleaded againſt law? It were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite to inſiſt on all particulars: for infinite are the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of theſe times.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> But the vſes which we may make of this point are theſe: firſt, it ſhould teach vs to beare with ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as are earneſt againſt the corruptions of the time. If euer there was need that miniſters ſhould crie ſhame againſt the abhominations of the times, ſurely much more now: for neuer was the world more full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as I ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhould teach vs to be the more vigilant ouer our ſelues, leſt we be corrupted. It muſt be our care to keepe our ſelues vnſpotted of the world, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. the laſt verſe. If it were an infectious time, how proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would men and women be to auoid the infection? Shall we be ſo carefull for our bodies, and ſhall we not be much more circumſpect for our ſoules? Yes by all meanes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this may teach vs to iuſtifie God in all his viſitations and iudgements. If God bring vpon vs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſword, peſtilence, or the like; the cauſe (if we conſider it well) is moſt iuſt: for the world is full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10122:27"/> and full of ſinne. If God drowne the world, there is ſufficient cauſe why he ſhould do ſo, for all fleſh had corrupted their wayes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this ſhould make vs willing to die, and to leaue this world, becauſe it is ſo full of corruption. We muſt not deſire death in reſpect of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but we may deſire it in reſpect of ſinne; euen as <hi>Elias</hi> when he ſaw idolatrie publiquely erected in the dayes of <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> he deſired God to take away his life, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Through luſt.</hi> By luſt here we are to vnderſtand ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne: ſo that the point to be obſerued is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne is the cauſe of all theſe innumerable corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in the world.</hi> This is manifeſt out of <hi>Iames</hi> 1.14. But euery man is tempted when he is drawne away of his owne luſt, and is enticed; then when luſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, it bringeth forth ſinne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſame Apoſtle ſaith to the ſame effect in <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.1. From whence come warres and fightings amongſt you, come they not from hence, euen of your luſts which fight in your members? Our Sauiour likewiſe implies he ſame in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.18.19. For out of the heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed euill thoughts, that is, from the heart polluted with originall ſinne. Thus <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he had committed adulterie and murther, acknowledged, that in ſinne his mother had conceiued him, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51. as implying thereby, that originall ſinne was the cauſe of the other ſinnes. Thus likewiſe <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Roman.</hi> 7. acknowledgeth that he was led captiue into ſinne by the law of ſinne, which was in his members. And for this cauſe thoſe fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene actuall ſins ſpoken of in <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.19.20. are called fruits of the fleſh. All theſe places do ſufficiently proue, that all corruptions are, or do flow from originall ſinne.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:10122:28"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Yea but ſwearing in common talke, it cometh of the euill one, <hi>Math.</hi> 5 37. and ſinne is called the luſts of the diuell, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.44. therefore it ſeemeth that ſinne comes from the diuell, and not of our owne luſts. I anſwer: Sin comes from both, but eſpecially, and immediatly from our naturall corruption: for were it not for this, Satan could do nothing at all vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let the due conſideration of this point teach vs, not to impute our ſinnes vnto others, but eſpecially to our ſelues. Secondly, let vs labour to mortifie the fleſh by the Spirit, and ſo we ſhall weaken all ſinne. Let vs drie vp the fountaine, and the ſtreames muſt needs ceaſſe.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Which ſerues to cleare Gods iuſtice in the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a ſinner. Euery ſinner is worthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, becauſe he ſinnes without compulſion. God may iuſtly ſay vnto a graceleſſe perſon, Who compelled

                  <hi>Beſides this.</hi> Or moreouer, for ſo the Text is read the beſt. Now the Apoſtle cometh to his exhortation: and the maine matter whereunto he exhorteth the Church is, that it giue all diligence for the attaining of grace. And this he doth from this fifth verſe, vnto the end of the eleuenth. In the next place he ſheweth the reaſons why he thus adhorteth, from the twelfth verſe, to the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10122:29"/> end of the Chapter. In the former obſerue we firſt, what is exhorted, and that is, to adde one grace to another, in 5.6. and 7. verſes. Secondly, the arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this exhortation is preſſed, in the 8.9.10. and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſides this.</hi> That is, ouer and aboue the gift of diuine nature, which you haue receiued, giue, or bring with you (as the word ſignifieth) all diligence, &amp;c. Whence note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>no Chriſtian muſt content himſelfe with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace, which he hath receiued in his firſt conuerſion, but he must to the firſt labour to adde other graces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The grace of regeneration is our talent, which we muſt ſo employ, as that we may gaine fiue talents more, <hi>Matthew.</hi> 25. This was the godly practiſe of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. where he ſaith, I forget thoſe things which are behinde, reaching forth to thoſe things which are before, &amp;c. They therefore which can content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with that grace which they ſuppoſe they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and thinke they need no more; it is a manifeſt ſigne they haue receiued nothing yet, as they ought to receiue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giuing all diligence.</hi> Or according to the originall; bringing all diligence. The doctrine hence to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a great deale of diligence required for the obtaining of increaſe of grace.</hi> True it is, that the firſt grace, to wit, the grace of regeneration, cometh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our paines or ſeeking. We are called ſodainly when we thinke leaſt of any ſuch matter, as we ſee in <hi>Paul</hi> and others. But as for increaſe of grace, it is not without great induſtrie and diligence. <hi>Dauid</hi> was eminent in grace, but he was withall very diligent in the vſe of meanes. For the obtaining of the ſame he prayed often,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10122:30"/> he faſted much; he meditated in Gods word day and night. The like may be ſaid of other of Gods Saints, who haue not obtained that degree of grace which they haue, without much paines and great ſtriuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which ſerues to condemne thoſe ſlow-bellies which would be content to receiue ſauing grace, but they are loath to take any paines for it: if God will put it in their mouthes, well and good; but if not, they are reſolued not to ſeeke it. O wretched man whoſoeuer thou art! art thou content to labour and toile, and to vſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diligence for the obtaining of the things of this life, and haſt thou no paines for things of a better life? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy condemnation ſleepeth not.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, this may ſerue to reproue ſuch which are the means to diſcourage others from the diligent ſearch of grace; labouring to perſwade them that they are too forward, and the like. O impudent practiſe! doth God require all diligence for the acquiring of grace? and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thou ſay, that diligence is more then needs? O cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed tongue, which contradicteſt thy Maker! how wilt thou eſcape vengeance?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Laſtly, this may ſerue to exhort all of vs, to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of more diligence in the ſeeking of grace. We ſee worldlings omit no paines, but vſe all diligence to get wealth. Shall they be ſo buſie for the earth, and ſhall not we be much more diligent for heauen? Let vs learne of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adde to your faith, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerue here, we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie exhorted to get faith, but likewiſe other graces: ſo that the point to be noted, is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>A Chriſtian muſt not content himſelfe with one good gift of the Spirit, but he muſt labour for many gifts.</hi> For this we haue the example
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10122:30"/> of the Corinthians, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.7. Who came behinde in no good gift, and of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with ſeuerall gifts. A true ſeruant of God muſt deſire gifts whereby to glorifie God in his calling, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Secondly, he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſauing gifts, which may diſtinguiſh him from repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, as faith, and holineſſe, and ſuch like; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, euery Chriſtian muſt labor for that grace wherein he is moſt defectiue, and which is moſt contrary to his corruptions. The angry perſon muſt eſpecially labor for patience; the laſciuious perſon for chaſtitie; the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſon for humilitie; the niggard for liberalitie; the intemperate man for ſobrietie, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may iuſtly condemne the common multitude: for if they haue but one good qualitie in them, they are prone to bleſſe themſelues in their eſtate, though they neglect all other good gifts of Gods Spirit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, let it put euery one of vs in minde, to take notice what graces we do eſpecially want, and let vs endeuour to obtaine thoſe graces. Let vs forget that which is behinde, and reach forward to that which is before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adde to your faith vertue.</hi> By vertue we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand an honeſt and good life, or an vniuerſall practiſe of all thoſe graces which God hath put in vs. Thus the good woman which was ſo painefull in her calling, ſo faithfull to her husband, ſo bountifull to the poore, is termed a vertuous woman, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.10.</p>
               <p>The leſſon hence to be learned, is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>euery Chriſtian ſhould labour to be truly vertuous, to be of a good life and canuerſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:10122:31"/>
               <p>Thus we are taught, not onely in this Text, <hi>Adde to your faith vertue:</hi> but alſo in <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.8. Finally bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whatſoeuer things are true, whatſoeuer things are honeſt, whatſoeuer things are iuſt, whatſoeuer things are pure, whatſoeuer things are louely, whatſoeuer things are of good report; if there be any vertue, or if there be any praiſe, thinke on theſe things For this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we haue the examples of the Saints; as firſt the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ruth,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, That all the City knew her to be a vertuous woman, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3.11. and of the good woman in <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.29. Many daughters haue done ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, but thou excelleſt them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeed there is great neceſſitie of vertue; firſt, becauſe God is more glorified by deeds then words. It is true, there muſt be both, we muſt profeſſe, and we muſt be vertuous; but the latter bringeth more glorie to God then the former. Hereby (ſaith Chriſt) is my Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, that ye bring forth much fruit, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ought to be vertuous, becauſe vertue is the power of profeſſion. He or ſhe that profeſſeth Chriſt and is not vertuous, their profeſſion is a powerleſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it is of no validitie, of no force; yea indeed it is meere hypocriſie, 2. <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.5. They haue a forme of godlineſſe, but deny the power thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we ought to be vertuous, becauſe this will ſooner conuince the wicked then any thing elſe: ſome which will not be wonne by the word, will be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a good conuerſation, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Now if there ought to be vertue amongſt men, then how iuſtly may we reproue the viciouſneſſe of the time? For, when did blaſphemy, and profaneneſſe, and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and drunkenneſſe, and deceit, and lying, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10122:31"/> pride, and idleneſſe, and vſurie, and all kindes of vices more abound then at theſe dayes? How hard is it now to finde a vertuous perſon?</p>
               <p>Secondly, this muſt teach euery one of vs to labour for a vertuous life and practiſe. Let Miniſters, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Maiſters of families, ſeruants, children, and all ſorts, from the higheſt to the loweſt, labour to be truly vertuous; that is, let vs all become zealous hearers of Gods word, and conſcionable doers and practiſers of the ſame. Oh how happy were it for vs, if we would ſuffer our ſelues to be perſwaded this way. The Lord perſwade vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adde to your faith.</hi> Concerning faith we purpoſe to ſpeake hereafter (if GOD permit) amongſt the Grounds of Religion: The point therefore which we will obſerue in this place, is this, to wit, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Vertue muſt be added vnto Faith.</hi> Indeed it muſt flowe from faith as from the fountaine; and the reaſon is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: firſt, becauſe elſe it is were ſinne. For, whatſoeuer is not of faith (whatſoeuer ſhew it may make) it is ſinne, <hi>Romans</hi> 14.23. Secondly, becauſe without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11.6. So that Vertue without faith is no better then <hi>Caines</hi> ſacrifice: It may giue ſatisfaction to men, but it is an abhomination to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerues to diſcouer the nakedneſſe of ciuill ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Many of the heathen were vertuous, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled for iuſtice, others for fortitude, others for tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, others for prudence. But becauſe their vertues were not added to faith, therefore they were but gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering ſinnes, they did not pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this proues againſt Papiſts, that our beſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10122:32"/> workes are not meritorious, <hi>ex opere operato.</hi> For if they were, what need vertue be added to faith to make it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable? Yea the truth is, that whatſoeuer is offered to God by an vnregenerate perſon, which is deſtitute of faith: it is no better then if he ſhould kill a man, or cut off a dogs necke, <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it muſt teach vs to vſe all meanes whereby faith may be wrought and increaſed in our hearts: for, ſo much faith as we haue, ſo much acceptation of vertue we ſhall finde with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Whence note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not ſufficient for a Christian to be vertuous, but he muſt haue knowledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in <hi>Prouer.</hi> 4.5. Get wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, get vnderſtanding, forget it not, &amp; in the ſeuenth verſe, Wiſedome is the principall thing; therefore get wiſedome, and with all thy getting get vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>There be many motiues to moue vs to ſeeke after knowledge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe, by it we are tranſlated out of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo by conſequence, out of the kingdome of Satan.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe by it we come to haue the image of God drawne vpon vs afreſh, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe in want of it, we are eſtranged from the life of God: we remaine by ignorance in the ſtate of death, that is, deſtitute of the life of Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by ignorance wee are lyable to temporall iudgements. <hi>For want of knowledge my people are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. yea to eternall damnation, 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Chriſt will come in flaming fire, rendering vengeance to all them which know not God.</hi> We may as ſafely liue in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as liue blinde and ignorant; both are damnable.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:10122:32"/>
               <p>But what kind of knowledge is it which we muſt ioyne to our vertue?</p>
               <p>Surely it is not meant of worldly wiſedome, much leſſe of ſinfull craft and ſubtlety, neither is it meant of a bare litterall knowledg in the braine.</p>
               <p>But it is meant of an holy experimentall knowledge, wrought in the hearts of the elect by the holy Ghoſt, and that by the meanes of Gods word.</p>
               <p>By which experimentall knowledge, we come firſt to know our ſelues, to wit, our curſed eſtate by nature. He that knoweth not himſelfe to be in a damnable ſtate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, to be vnder the wrath of God, and guilty of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſinne; he that is not conuicted of the neceſſity of repentance and of the new birth, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by this experimentall knowledg, we come to know God and Chriſt. God to be our Father, Chriſt to be our Redeemer, the holy Ghoſt to be our ſanctifier and comforter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by this experimentall knowledge learned from Gods word, we come to know Gods will, to wit, what to auoide and what to follow, what to beleeue and what to reiect, how God will be worſhipped, and the like.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by this experimentall knowledge, we come more and more to know the wiles of Satan, the deceits of our owne hearts, the wayes of Gods prouidence, the wayes of Gods workes, and the like.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, By what meanes may we attaine this precious grace of ſauing knowledge?</p>
               <p>To ſuch I anſwer, If thou deſire to attaine this grace, then firſt labour for humilitie: be a foole in thine owne
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10122:33"/> opinion: for the Lord teacheth the humble his way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſearch the Scriptures, for they are able to make thee wiſe to ſaluation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if thou lack wiſedome, aske it of God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1</p>

                  <hi>Temperance.</hi> It is the moderation of luſt and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, in the vſe of the gifts and creatures of God.</p>
               <p>As firſt in the vſe of meats &amp; drinks: a temperate perſon will not waſt and ruine his eſtate in frequent and riotous feaſting, neither doth he deſire to fare deliciouſly euery day. Yea if he liue in ſuch a place where there is great fare and plenty of wine, hee hath learned to moderate himſelfe concerning meaſure, partaking only ſo farre of Gods creatures, as thereby he is made more fit to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God. There is great want of this branch of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at this day, as appeares by the riotous feaſting, by the drunkenneſſe and gluttony of the time.</p>
               <p>Now the remedies againſt this intemperance, are firſt to remember that in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. Take heede leſt at any time your hearts be ouercharged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to remember the examples of the Saints, as of the three children in <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.8. who could not be tempted with the kings diet.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let vs conſider that drunkards and gluttons ſhall haue their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.21. And let this moue vs to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of temperance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, temperance is ſeene in the moderation of apparell. A temperate perſon will apparell himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſexe, according to his place, according to the moſt modeſt faſhion of his countrey, according to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10122:33"/> his ability, and the like. There is alſo great want of this branch of temperance, men are turned women, and women are turned men at theſe dayes: euery faſhion is in vſe but that which is moſt modeſt, and how vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably do men and women flaunt it out, farre aboue their degree and place? What difference is there in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell betweene a Gentlewoman and a Lady; betweene a Lady and a Counteſſe; betweene a Gentleman and a Knight; and a Knight and a Lord; betweene a Cittizen and a Courtier? No man knoweth his place and degree.</p>
               <p>But let all intemperate perſons in this kinde remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.8. It ſhall come to paſſe in the day of the Lords Sacrifice, that I will puniſh the Princes &amp; the kings children, &amp; all ſuch as are cloathed in ſtrange appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. Now if God could not endure pride of apparell in Princes, how ſhal he endure it in perſons of meane rank?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Patience.</hi> It is the due moderation of anger: and it is ſeene eſpecially in the quiet and peaceable enduring of afflictions.</p>
               <p>There is a double patience; one towards God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards men: both of theſe we muſt labour to adde vnto our knowedge.</p>
               <p>Patience towards God, is nothing elſe but an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meeke and quiet ſubmitting our ſelues to Gods correction, in what kinde ſoeuer he ſhall thinke fit to chaſtiſe vs. And this kind of Patience is enioyned in <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.11. <hi>My ſonne deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be weary of his correction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The arguments which ſhould moue vs to this kinde of patience are theſe: Gods greatneſſe; he is able to do what he will, and therefore it is but folly to carry our ſelues frowardly towards him, we cannot reſiſt him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10122:34"/> we muſt remember how they haue ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, we muſt conſider, how iuſtly we do deſerue any ſcourge which God inflicts vpon vs; and our iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſhould make vs patient <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt remember that God correcteth vs for our profit, as namely to make vs partakers of his holineſſe and the like, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. And ſhall we not be patient to ſuffer for our owne good?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, conſider we the examples of the Saints, how patiently did they endure their trials, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.10.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this point may be: firſt for our triall and examination; try we our ſelues whether we be truely patient vnder Gods chaſtiſing hand or no, and the ſignes of patience are theſe.

I was dumbe and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we ſubmit to the will of God, in our very extremitie, as Chriſt did, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.39. Neuertheleſſe not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we can bleſſe God in the very fire of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as <hi>Iob</hi> did; The Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.21.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> In the next place, this point may ſerue iuſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue vs, for want of this kinde of patience. What mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring thereis in time of vnſeaſonable weather, our own eares may be witneſſes: and ſo in like manner, how ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnely we carry our ſelues towards God if he touch vs, our owne conſciences will eaſily teſtifie. My brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Patience.</hi> The ſecond branch of patience, is that which we muſt exerciſe towards men. That is alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this Text, and we finde it commanded in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of Scripture, as in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Now we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you brethren, warne them which are vnruly, comfort the feeble minded, ſupport the weake, be patient towards all men.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11. <hi>But thou ô man of God, flie theſe things, and follow after righteouſneſſe, godlineſſe, faith, loue, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, meekeneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt be patient towards men, if they take away
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10122:35"/> our goods, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.40. if they take away our good names, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.11. yea if they take away our liues, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 53.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And great reaſon we ſhould be patient in this kinde.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe men could do nothing if God did not bid them. This was that which made <hi>Dauid</hi> patient when <hi>Shimei</hi> rayled vpon him, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe if men perſecute vs, it is becauſe they are ignorant, they know not what they do: and this made Chriſt patient, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe all the perſecutions of men, ſhall turne to our good: for the more we are perſecuted, the more we are tryed in this world, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.33. and the more we ſhall be glorified in the world to come, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Yea, but mine enemy hath done me eſpeciall iniury. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> Surely if thy enemy hath done the iniury, yet conſider that thou thy ſelfe doſt greater iniury to God. Euery day the Lord beareth with thee, and is patient; oughteſt not thou to do the like to thy brother?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Yea, but if I ſhould put vp ſuch a wrong, it were a great indignity and diſgrace vnto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Thou thinkeſt then that to ſeeke reuenge, is a meanes to maintaine thy credit: but thou art deceiued, for it is a mans honour to paſſe by an offence, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 20.3.</p>
               <p>Labour for this excellent grace, and that firſt becauſe anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles, <hi>Ec.</hi> 7.9. Secondly, becauſe cauſles anger is man-ſlaughter, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.15. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God. Fourthly, becauſe vengeance is peculiar to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. Fiftly, becauſe it is the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10122:35"/> in the world, for a man to rule his owne ſpirit, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.32.</p>
               <p>Trie your ſelues alſo, whether you haue in any ſort this grace or no; and the ſignes of it are theſe. Firſt, if we can forgiue from our hearts our enemies. Secondly, if we can heartily pray for them. Thirdly, if we can do them good in their neceſſitie. Fourthly, if we can be grieued when we heare any ill to befall them. Theſe are euident ſignes of patience. Although we reproue them for ſinne, and though we cannot endure their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet if we can finde theſe markes, we may be ſure we haue patience in the roote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Godlineſſe.</hi> It is a ſincere deſire, and conſcionable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour after an vniuerſall conformity to Gods reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will. I ſay, after an vniuerſall conformity; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that an hypocrite is a godly perſon, becauſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he doth many things praeſcribed in the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet he is ſound tardy and foule in the ſecond, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we ſay that a prophane perſon is godly, becauſe howſoeuer he doth many things praeſcribed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, yet he is careleſſe in yeelding obedience to the firſt: But he or ſhe are true godly perſons, which ſincerely deſire, and conſcionably endeauour to yeelde vniuerſall obedience to Gods moſt holy will. I do not deny but the word tranſlated godlineſſe in this text, doth properly ſignify in the greeke, a right worſhip of God, but I take it, that the holy-Ghoſt doth ſpeake it Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochically, putting the right worſhip of God, which is but a part of godlineſſe, for all godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>The point hence to be noted is, that euery true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to labour for godlineſſe, or vniuerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Gods will, and that for theſe reaſons. Firſt,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10122:36"/> Firſt, becauſe God commandeth ſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe true godlineſſe is a ſure marke of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe godlineſſe hath bene the practiſe of all Gods children from time to time, as of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Henock,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt, from whom we ought not to degenerate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">1. Obiection.</note> But ſome (poſſibly) will obiect, If I ſhould ſet my ſelfe for godlineſſe, I ſhould be ſcoffed at and derided, and hated and perſecuted.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is moſt true, that whoſoeuer will liue godly in Chriſt Ieſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. but it is as true, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer denieth Chriſt before men, ſhall be denied by Chriſt at the laſt day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">2. Obiection.</note> Others it may be will obiect, Yea but your definition of godlineſſe is too ſtrict, for who is able to conforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vniuerſally to the will of God?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, We do not affirme that godlineſſe is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute perfect conformity, but that it is a ſincere deſire and conſcionable endeuour after vniuerſall conformitie. And that this is neuer a whit too ſtrict, it is apparent out of <hi>Math.</hi> 5.48. where Chriſt himſelfe exhorteth vs to be perfect, as out Father which is in heauen is perfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this point may be, firſt, to reproue the world of vngodlineſſe; euery ſinne is vngodlineſſe, and when did ſinne euer more abound then at theſe dayes?</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth iuſtly to condemne ſuch as ſcoffe and mocke and deride at godlineſſe, and at godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Curſed Iſmaelites they be; the Lord giue them repentance, if they belong to his election.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ſerueth to iuſtifie the godly practiſes of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10122:36"/> Gods children; they labour after godlineſſe, they do well, let them labour more after it: they do but that wch God himſelfe requireth of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this may ſerue to excite and to ſtirre vp all of vs to the ſtudy of godlineſſe; and that we may attaine thereunto, we muſt obſerue theſe rules following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt be content to part with our eſpeciall ſins; raigning ſinne and godlineſſe are like Dagon and the Arke, they can neuer ſtand together. <hi>Will you ſteale, murther, commit adultery, and ſweare falſly, and burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe vnto Baal, and walke after other gods whom ye know not, and come and ſtand before me in this Houſe, whereupon my Name is called.</hi> It is the ſpeech of God himſelf vnto the Iewes in <hi>Ieremie</hi> 7.9.10. wherein he doth reproue them for thinking, that godlineſſe &amp; raigning ſin might ſtand together. The like reproofe you haue in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 50.16.17. I will not name it, I leaue it to your owne reading. But by both theſe places you may plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, that if we will be profeſſours of the Goſpell, or true godly perſons, we muſt forſake ſinne. I conclude this point with that ſpeech of the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Timothie</hi> chapter 2. verſe 19. <hi>Let euery one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if we deſire to be truly godly, we muſt be carefull to keepe the Sabbath; it is a ſure marke of an vngodly perſon, to be a Sabbath-breaker, as on the contrarie it is an euidence of godlineſſe, conſcionably to celebrate it to Gods glorie: he that is an Eunuch to God, keepeth Gods Sabbath, as it is in <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.4. The holy keeping of the Sabbath is a means to hallow vs the better for all the weeke after; whereas the profaning of the Sabbath is the cauſe of profaneneſſe &amp; vngodlineſſe,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10122:37"/> if God be not more mercifull all our life after.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we deſire to be truly godly, we muſt be carefull of priuate duties of Religion: we muſt pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, 1. <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 5. We muſt meditate in the law of the Lord day and night, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 1. We muſt beate downe our bodies and keepe them vnder, 1. <hi>Corinthians</hi> 9. the laſt. We muſt daily examine our ſelues, and daily repent, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 4.4. The way to be truly godly, is, throughly to exerciſe our ſelues in theſe and the like duties.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we deſire to be truly godly, we muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate our ſelues with ſuch as are godly. We muſt not inhaunt our ſelues with vngodly perſons; for that is the way to be made vngodly: but with Saints and holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. So long as <hi>Peter</hi> kept company with Chriſt, he was religious and holie, but when he came amongſt the high Prieſts ſeruants, how profane was he, in denying his Maiſter, in ſwearing, and forſwearing, and the like? <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>And by theſe ſame rules we may alſo trie whether we be truly godly or no: he that obſerueth theſe rules, is godly: he that obſerues them not, is certainly vngodly.</p>

               <p>Secondly, becauſe they are borne, I meane, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne of one and the ſame mother, <hi>Galat</hi> 4.26.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe they are brought vp in the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe they ſhall be partakers of the ſame inheritance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerues to condemne the practiſe of ſuch which do ſcoffe at this terme Brethren, ſaying, He is one of the holy brethren, and the like: Oh thou wretch!

               <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach rich Chriſtians humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; they muſt know that the pooreſt Chriſtian is their brother or ſiſter, and therefore they muſt carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues accordingly towards them: they muſt not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of them; for if Chriſt himſelfe be not aſhamed to call vs Brethren, as it is in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.10. then we muſt not be aſhamed to owne one another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſhould teach poore Chriſtians thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe; God hath made them, by vertue of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion akinne to the greateſt Nobles and Potentates in the world: I meane, to ſuch Potentates as are true fearers of God.

               <p>Thirdly, we muſt auoid tyrannizing ouer Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; we muſt remember they are our brethren.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, conſidering that all that feare God, are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, therefore this muſt teach vs diuers things: it muſt teach vs indeed to carry our ſelues towards our fellow-Chriſtians as towards brethren: therefore, as one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſtand by another, ſo one Chriſtian muſt defend another; we muſt not ſuffer any Chriſtian to be wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if it be in our power to helpe him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, one brother will haue a fellow-feeling with another; they will reioyce to ſee any good to befall one another, and they will grieue to ſee hurt. Euen ſo we muſt reioyce to heare of the proſperity of <hi>Zion,</hi> and we muſt grieue to heare or to ſee the deſolation thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, one brother will do for another according to abilitie; euen ſo we muſt euery one according to his abilitie do for the Church of God. If a brother or ſiſter be naked or deſtitute of daily food, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Iames</hi> 2.15. we muſt relieue them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brotherly kindneſſe,</hi> or brotherly loue. In the next place we are to obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>There ought to be loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Chriſtians, yea brotherly loue.</hi> This is proued by 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Loue as brethren.</hi> and out of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Let brotherly loue continue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there be eſpeciall motiues to ſtirre vs vp to this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10122:38"/> loue: firſt becauſe it is a ſigne that we are tranſlated from death to life. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. Secondly, that we are borne of God, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.7. Thirdly, that we are of the truth, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. Fourthly, that God dwelleth in vs, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſti.</note> But how ſhould I know a true Chriſtian, that I may loue him as a brother?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Thou mayeſt know him: firſt, by his faith; he lookes for ſaluation by Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by his humility; he thinketh baſely of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by his loue to Gods houſe, the place where Gods honour dwelleth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by his language, for he ſpeakes the holie language of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, by his practiſe and life; for he liueth holily, righteouſly, and ſoberly in this preſent world.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, by his fruitfulneſſe; for he is no barren fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, but he bringeth forth fruit in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, by his oppoſition in this world; for his ſect is euill ſpoken of in euery place, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.22. Thus thou mayeſt know a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Now, is it ſo, that true Chriſtians, and true fearers of the Lord are to be beloued with brotherly loue? Then this ſerues iuſtly to rebuke the world for want of this brotherly loue. The world is ſo farre from louing the godly, as that they hate no people in the world more. A fearefull ſigne of a bad eſtate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may ſerue to reproue, euen Chriſtians themſelues; for where is that loue which ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs? Surely, it is either growne cold, or elſe, which is worſe, its turned into preiudice and enuy: but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10122:39"/> I will ſay with the Apoſtle in another caſe; My brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this muſt teach vs to be thankfull to God, in that he hath commanded all to loue vs, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vs. We may iuſtly ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> Lord, what is man that thou thus regardeſt him? The truth is, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be hated both of God and man: Therefore it is the greater mercy of God, not only to loue vs himſelfe, but alſo to command others to loue vs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let this teach vs to examine our ſelues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we loue the brethren or no. And that will appeare by theſe ſignes: Firſt, if we loue poore Chriſtians aſwell as rich; if our loue be towards all the Saints, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we loue not in tongue onely, but in deed and in truth; if we loue ſincerely, from the heart, and fruitfully, doing them all the good we can.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we thinke our ſeruice for the Church to be eaſie, as <hi>Iacob</hi> thought his ſeuen yeares ſeruice for <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> it is a ſigne we loue.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we continue in our loue towards Gods Saints. The continuance proues our loue to be true, the not continuing argueth hypocriſie in our loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charitie.</hi> By this we are to vnderſtand the practiſe or expreſſion of brotherly loue. In the former grace we are taught affection, in this grace we are taught action. The point is, that <hi>It is the part and dutie of euery Chriſtian, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the reſt of his gifts and graces, to labour for Charity.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preſſeth this duty with great feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13.1.2.3. ſhewing, that if one do neuer ſo great things, yet if he haue not Charitie, it auaileth him nothing.</p>
               <p>Now there is a two-fold charitie to be exerciſed by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10122:39"/> vs towards our brethren; the firſt is a charitie towards their ſoules, the ſecond is a charitie towards their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>The Charitie towards the ſoules of our brethren, is ſeene in theſe particulars: Firſt, in pitying their ſpirituall eſtate, if we ſee them out of the way; according to that in <hi>Iude</hi> 22. <hi>Haue compaſsion of ſome, in putting differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> Or if we ſee them deſtitute of the meanes of ſaluation, if they be as ſheep without a ſhepheard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9, 36. or if they be proud and obſtinate, <hi>Ieremy</hi> 13.17. <hi>But if yee will not heare it, my ſoule ſhall weepe in ſecret places for your pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Charitie towards the ſoules of others is ſeene in the inſtructing of them. The Centurion ſhewed himſelfe a true charitable perſon, in building a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.5. Yea, in this he was more charitable then if he had built them an Almeſ-houſe or Hoſpitall, by how much the ſoule is more excellent then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſpirituall charitie is ſeene in forgiuing our brethren, if they haue offended vs, and now come and ſay, It repenteth me; according to that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.33. <hi>Shouldſt not thou haue had compaſsion on thy fellow-ſeruant as I had compaſsion on thee?</hi> He that can forgiue without reuenge, is charitable.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſpirituall charitie is ſeene in reprouing and admoniſhing ſuch as are out of the way; and ſeeking their reformation, <hi>Leu.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſinne vpon him.</hi> And indeed, what greater charitie can there be then to labour to ſaue a ſoule from hell?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, ſpirituall charitie is ſeene in praying for the ſaluation of others. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed himſelfe a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10122:40"/> perſon in <hi>Romans</hi> 10.1. in that his hearts deſire and praier to God for Iſrael, was, that they might be ſaued.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may ſerue to reprooue the world of want of this ſpirituall charitie. For who amongſt a thouſand is charitable ſpiritually? Some will ſhew themſelues cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable in matters concerning the body; but what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of ſpirituall charity?</p>
               <p>Now the charitie towards the bodies of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours is ſeene in theſe things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In commiſerating their eſtate, to wit, in grieuing for the affliction of <hi>Ioſeph, Amos</hi> 6.6.</item>
                  <item>2. In viſiting them in their diſtreſſe, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.36.</item>

                  <item>5. In forgiuing them their debts, if they be not able to repay, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35.</item>
                  <item>6. In ſtanding in the gap, to turne away Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 106.23.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerues iuſtly to reproue ſuch as will reproue and exhort, and ſay, God helpe you, and the like; but they exerciſe no charitie toward the bodies of their brethren: theſe are hypocrites.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="verse">
               <p>
                  <hi>For if theſe things be in you.</hi> In the former verſes the holy Ghoſt hath exhorteth vs to labour for thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named graces, <hi>viz.</hi> faith, vertue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godlineſſe, brotherly kindneſſe and charitie: Now in the verſes following from the beginning of this eight verſe, to the end of the eleuenth, he preſſeth the ſaid exhortation with diuers arguments: Firſt, by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

               <p>Now in that the holy Ghoſt doth vſe ſo many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the enforcing of the exhortation to grace: it doth imply, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which may ſerue iuſtly to condemne our backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to that which is good, eſpecially conſidering how little perſwaſion will preuaile with vs, vnto that which is euill. We are ſoone tempted to ſinne; yea, oftentimes we tempt the Diuell to tempt vs, by running into pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of temptation: we are more ready to ſinne (if it be poſſible) then the Diuell can be to ſollicite vs thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If theſe things be in you.</hi> The words in the originall are very ſignificant; they may be read thus: if you haue theſe things, or if theſe things be preſent with you.</p>
               <p>Where we are to note that it is not ſaid, If you can talke of theſe things; or if you can purpoſe to labour for theſe things; or if you can wiſh theſe things: but, If you haue theſe things. Whence obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to talke of grace, or to profeſſe grace, but wee muſt haue grace in poſſeſſion:</hi> according to that in <hi>Marke</hi> 9.50. <hi>Haue ſalt in your ſelues, and peace one with another.</hi> Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> was full of matter, <hi>Iob.</hi> 32.18. And <hi>Stephen</hi> was full of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10122:41"/> faith and power, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.8. Thus the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched in euery thing, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. And in Chriſt the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwells bodily, <hi>Col.</hi> 2 9.</p>
               <p>And indeede, as the talke of riches profiteth nothing vnleſſe we haue the poſſeſſion of riches; ſo the talke of grace, and the profeſſion of grace is vaine, vnleſſe we be endued with grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which may ſeeme to condemne many which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues with wiſhes and formalities, but haue no ſubſtance of grace in them: But let ſuch remember that copper will not paſſe for gold with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If theſe things be in you,</hi> or, as the words in the originall will alſo beare it, <hi>If theſe things be preſent with you:</hi> whence obſerue we, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>it is not ſufficient to haue grace; but we ought to haue it alwaies in readineſſe, it ſhould not be at any time to ſeeke, but it ſhould ſtill be preſent with vs.</hi> This is that which is enioyned in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35. Let your loynes be gyrded about, and your lights burning, and ye your ſelues, like to the men which waite for their Lord, when he will returne from the wedding. And the want of this preſence of grace, Chriſt reproueth in his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.25. <hi>Where is your Faith?</hi> Their faith was to ſeeke when they had moſt neede of it; which was their ſinne. In this reſpect grace is compared to armour, or weapons; and Chriſtians to ſouldiers: becauſe as ſouldiers muſt neuer be without their weapons; ſo Chriſtians muſt neuer be without their graces. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt learne of Gentlemen, alwaies to walke with their ſwords by their ſides, that is, with grace.</p>
               <p>Vſe, againſt ſuch as content themſelues with vaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and purpoſes of grace; they meane to repent hereafter, and they purpoſe to breake off their ſinnes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10122:41"/> hereafter, and they ſay they will doe great matters here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: But what grace or reformation haue they for the preſent? Surely none.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may ſerue iuſtly to reprooue euen the very children of God, which are not ſo carefull as they ought to be, to keepe their graces in readineſſe. If any temptation come, they are to ſeeke, and their heart failes them. My brethren, take heed of this vnprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this muſt teach vs to vſe the meanes whereby to keepe the preſence and nimbleneſſe of grace, and for this end take theſe directions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, beware of ſinne; for ſinne takes away the heart of grace, and the ſence and feeling of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, be diligent in the vſe of Gods ordinances, for theſe maintaine in vs the life of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, daily examine thy ſelfe whether thou findeſt the graces of God in thee, in that meaſure as thou didſt finde them yeſterday or heretofore.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, labour to ſtirre vp the gift that is in thee, and the grace which thou haſt receiued. Fire, if it be not ſtirred vp, will burne deadly: So grace, if we do not quicken it vp, will ſoone decay.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, labour to exerciſe thy graces by daily practiſe; want of practiſe cauſeth any gift to decay; weapons, if they be not vſed, will ruſt in the ſcabbard; ſo will grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And abound.</hi> Whence obſerue we, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a Chriſtian to haue a truth of grace in him, but he muſt endeuour to abound in grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this we reade <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. And this I pray, that your loue may abound yet more and more, in knowledge and in all iudgement. And 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.12. And the Lord make
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10122:42"/> you to increaſe and abound in loue one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and thus <hi>Paul</hi> requires the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to abound to euery good worke, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. and rich men to be rich in good workes, 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 6.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerueth iuſtly to condemne our common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, in that we content our ſelues with ſo ſmall a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace, and labour not to abound therein.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſhould ſerue to ſtirre vs vp to labour to abound; and that we may ſo do, obſerue theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt abound in the vſe of meanes. Great riches, or aboundance, are not obtained, for the moſt part, without great paines and induſtry; no more are riches in grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We muſt imploy our talents: He that well imployeth his fiue talents, ſhall gayne other fiue; but he that will hide his talent in the earth and not vſe it, he ſhall not increaſe but decreaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And abound.</hi> The word in the originall is very ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, it ſignifieth properly to ſuperabound, or to abound more then needes. Not that there is any degree of grace, which is indeede more then needes: but it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in reſpect of the wicked, which eſteeme ſtrictneſſe of religion to be meere curioſitie.</p>
               <p>The point hence to be noted is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to labour for an holy ſtrictneſſe in profeſſion, yea for ſuch a degree of ſtrictneſſe as is eſteemed curioſity in the world.</hi> This we are taught alſo in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. Walke circumſpectly, or rather as the word in the originall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, walke accurately, or nicely.</p>
               <p>This we are taught alſo in <hi>Math.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye perfect.</hi> Vnto this ſtrictneſſe or holy curioſitie, the examples of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10122:42"/> the Saints ſhould moue vs. <hi>Dauid</hi> daunced before the Arke, although <hi>Michal</hi> eſteemed him a foole for his labour, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſerued the God of his Fathers, although that kinde of ſeruice was counted hereſie, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.14.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhould Chriſtians make queſtion, Whether it be lawfull to ſtand gazing at their dores in time of diuine Seruice vpon the Sabbath day? Whether it be lawfull to ſweare at all in common talke? Whether it be lawfull to receiue all gifts, though neuer ſo freely offered? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawfull to goe to the vttermoſt limits of lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in partaking of the things of this life; and thus in many other things.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This condemneth the practiſe of hypocrites, which will not be counted fooles for Chriſt, and therefore will profeſſe no further then will ſtand with their credits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſerues to condemne the practiſe of the wicked, which account all things which ſauour of any ſtrictneſſe, to be fooliſhneſſe and curioſitie; but let ſuch remember that in <hi>Iſay</hi> 5: Woe vnto them which call good euill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to encourage all holy Chriſtians in their ſtrictneſſe, let them goe on, and be yet more curious and ſcrupulous in auoiding all appearance of euill, although they be deſpiſed for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither idle.</hi> Some tranſlations reade it, <hi>neither bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren;</hi> but I rather agree to their iudgements which reade it <hi>neither idle.</hi> Firſt, becauſe the greeke word doth moſt properly ſignifie ſo, it being the ſame word which is vſed in <hi>Math.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Why ſtand ye here all the day idle?</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe otherwiſe here might ſeeme a vaine tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogie or repetition to be made: The firſt word, barren,

                  <hi>A true ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Chriſtian is no idle perſon.</hi> True Chriſtianity, and idleneſſe, they are as the Arke and Dagon, they cannot ſtand together. Thus <hi>Iacob</hi> was a true Chriſtian, and marke what paines he tooke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.40: The drought conſumed him by day, and the froſt by night, and the ſleepe departed from his eyes. Thus the good woman ſpoken of in <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. was a true Chriſtian, and behold ſhe ſeeketh wooll and flaxe, and worketh willingly with her hands; yea, ſhe riſeth whilſt it is night, and eateth not the bread of idleneſſe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.13.15.27. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> was a Chriſtian Miniſter, and he laboured more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly then they all, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. A Chriſtian hath a double calling to follow.

                  <hi>grace in the childe of God is the cauſe of painfulneſſe and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:10122:44"/> Of painfulneſſe; thus <hi>Paul</hi> was beſides himſelfe, as it were, in the ſeruency and labour of his miniſtery, becauſe the loue of Chriſt conſtraineth him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. Thus <hi>Noah,</hi> moued with feare prepared the Arke, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. Thus <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was conſtrained to preach, by that fire of grace which was within, <hi>Ier.</hi> 20 7. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> could not but ſpeake the things which they had ſeene &amp; heard, being moued by the Spirit of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. And this puts a difference between the painfulneſſe of worldlings &amp; of Chriſtians. World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are moued to painfulneſſe for greedineſſe of gaine, or the like, but Chriſtians by the motion of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come painfull; the one ſort are moued by an outward cauſe, the other by an inward.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as grace is the cauſe of painfulneſſe in the childe of God, ſo it is of fruitfulneſſe. For what moued <hi>Rahab</hi> to receiue the Spies, and to hide them from the rage of their enemies, but faith? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.31. What mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the good Samaritane to take care of the wounded man? <hi>Luke</hi> 10.33. but his inward compaſſion. What moueth the good man to lend? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.5. but mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and louing fauour. And this alſo ſerues to put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a true Chriſtian and an hypocrite. For an hypocrite doth all for an outward cauſe, to wit, to be ſeene of men; but a true Chriſtian doth that which he doth, in ſinceritie, and by the inward motion of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt conſiſts mainly in thoſe things: firſt, in knowing him to be very God: ſecondly, to be very man: thirdly, to be God and man in one perſon: fourthly, to be the ſecond perſon in the Trinitie, equall to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: fiftly, to be conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, borne
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10122:45"/> of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſo as followeth of him in the Creed: ſixtly, to know him to be the true Meſſiah, to be the onely Sauiour, to be a King to rule ouer vs, a Prieſt to offer Sacrifice for vs, and a Prophet to inſtruct vs: ſeuenthly, to know him experimentally, to know the working of his Spirit, the vertue of his death, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, reſurrection, aſcenſion, mediation, and the like.</p>
               <p>This is the chiefe knowledge of all others, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle acknowledgeth, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.8. yea it is eternall life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. And <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe deſired to know nothing but Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucified, 1. <hi>Corint.</hi> 2.2. Yea, if a man knew all other ſecrets, and were ignorant of Chriſt, he knew nothing as he ought to know.</p>
               <p>Now the means to attaine this excellent knowledge, which paſſeth knowledge, is: Firſt, to pray vnto God, that he would reueale the Sonne to vs; for none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Sonne but the Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.22.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to ſearch the Scriptures, for they are they which teſtifie of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.19.</p>

                  <hi>He is blinde.</hi> Hence we are to obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Euerie graceleſſe perſon is a blind perſon:</hi> and ſo they are termed in diuers places of Scripture, as in <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.7. where Chriſt is ſaid to be giuen as a Couenant of the People, and a Light of thr Gentiles, to open the blinde eies, and to bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſſe out of the priſon houſe: and in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 1.21. where it is ſaid of the graceleſſe heathen, That their fooliſh heart was darkned: and in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.14. where it is ſaid of the graceleſſe Phariſes, That they were blinde leaders of the blinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And fitly may a graceleſſe perſon be compared to a blinde man for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:10122:45"/>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe, as a blinde man is apt to ſtray out of his way, and yet to thinke himſelfe to be in the way; ſo a graceles perſon is prone to erre from the way of Gods precepts, and yet ſtill to ſuppoſe that he is in the ready way to heauen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe, as a blinde man walketh on and ſeeth no danger, but thinkes himſelfe ſafe vntill he drop into a pit: euen ſo a graceleſſe perſon goeth on in his wicked courſe, and is ſecure vntill he ſodainly drop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe, as a blinde man may eaſily be wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his meats, and drinkes, and the like, taking that to be wholeſome which is vnwholeſome; euen ſo grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſons may eaſily be wronged in their ſpirituall diet, taking that to be wholeſome doctrine which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and vnwholeſome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe, as a blind man is depriued of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort; he ſeeth not the glorie of the Sunne, nor the beauty of the Moone, nor the pleaſantneſſe of the fields and of euery tree: euen ſo a graceleſſe perſon is deſtitute of all ſound conſolation; he may ſeeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the face, but he cannot reioyce in the heart.</p>

               <p>Secondly, the diuel the prince of darkneſſe doth blind the eies of infidels, that the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt might not ſhine vnto them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:10122:46"/>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Now, is it ſo, that euery graceleſſe perſon is blinde? Then this doth iuſtly meet with that proud ſelfe-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe which is in graceleſſe perſons, eſpecially if they be rich, or learned in humane learning, in that they are ready to ſay with the proud Phariſes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.40. <hi>Are we alſo blinde?</hi> Vnto whom we may anſwer, Yes verily, ye are alſo blinde, being graceleſſe. For whoſoeuer hath not theſe things, is blinde.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this teacheth vs to take notice of this blindneſſe, and to labour to get out of it; let vs crie after Chriſt as <hi>Bartimeus</hi> did, <hi>Marke</hi> 10.51. and let vs neuer giue ouer our ſuite, vntill we obtaine that ſpirituall eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalue whereby we may ſee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſheweth what need euery congregation hath of a guide, I meane of a faithfull and vnderſtanding Miniſter. A blinde perſon hath not more need of one to leade him, then we haue of Miniſters to guide vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And cannot ſee afarre off.</hi> The word in the originall ſignifieth winking with the eies. Whence we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>A graceleſſe perſon is wilfully ignorant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is proued out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.15. Their eyes they haue cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eies; and out of 2. <hi>Peter</hi> 3.5. This they willingly are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of. And out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. Light came into the world; and men loue darkneſſe more then light.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee multitudes which will not come where they may be inſtructed, refuſing to com to the Church, refuſing to dwel in Chriſtian houſes, abhorring to come in the company of the wiſe, and all becauſe they would not be inſtructed.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Secondly, becauſe they are ſelfe-conceited, and think that they know ſufficient, when indeed they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as they ought to know.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe they are prone to haue a preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate opinion of knowledge, eſteeming baſely of it; like vnto fooles which prize bables at an high rate, but deſpiſe things precious.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Secondly, let euerie one examine themſelues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be guiltie yea or no of this ſinne; and it will appeare by theſe markes: for firſt, if thou contemne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull preaching, and wilfully neglect it: ſecondly, if thou art loath that thy conſcience ſhould be pricked with the ſence and feeling of thy ſinne: thirdly, if thou hateſt them that would inſtruct thee: fourthly, if thou ſhunneſt the company and places where knowledge is to be learned: fiftly, if thou ſtandeſt at a ſtay, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureſt not to increaſe in knowledge: ſixtly, if thou haſt a baſe eſteeme of knowledge; thou needeſt go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſeeke markes, thou art wilfully ignorant. And therefore pray God to giue thee repentance, that thou maieſt eſcape his wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſinnes.</hi> By old ſinnes we are to vnderſtand ſinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of old: and graceleſſe perſons are ſaid here to be

Laſtly, graceleſſe perſons are ſaid to forget this great worke of redemption by Chriſt, to intimate, that they are groſſely vnthankfull for the ſame. Thus you ſee the meaning of the words.</p>

                  <hi>Euery man and woman are ſinners of old.</hi> The wicked (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) are eſtranged from the wombe, they go aſtray as ſoone as they be borne, ſpeaking lies, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 58.5. Haſt thou marked the old way which wicked men haue troden? ſaith <hi>Eliphas, Iob</hi> 22.15. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> maketh mention of the ſinnes of his youth, <hi>Iob</hi> 13.26. and <hi>Dauid</hi> of the ſinne wherein he was conceiued, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51: all implying that men and women are ſinners of old.</p>
               <p>Beſides proofes out of Scriptures, we ſee it manifeſt by wofull experience in the world. For do we not ſee children, before they can ſpeake plaine, to be ſubiect to take Gods name in vaine, to lie, to be proud, to be vaine, and the like? Yes, it is too manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let it therefore teach vs, not onelie to repent of our yeſterdaies ſinnes, and of our new ſinnes, but alſo of our old ſinnes.

And be it farre from vs to extenuate or mince the ſinnes of old, as though they were nothing, becauſe they were committed in our minoritie, or for want of wit, and the like. And much more let vs abhorre
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10122:47"/> to boaſt of our old ſinnes, as it is the manner of many doting ſinners. But let vs know that old ſinnes muſt haue new repentance; or if they haue not new repentance, certainly we may looke that they ſhall haue new iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <hi>Purged.</hi> Whence note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be purged euen from old ſinnes, that is, from the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe and puniſhment of them.</hi> There is a fountaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem for ſinne and for vncleanneſſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1.</p>
               <p>If anie ſhall demand what fountaine this is which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth away ſinne: I anſwer, It is no other but the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud of the Lord Ieſus; according to that of <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 1.5.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let vs make this vſe of the point: firſt, in that there is a fountaine opened, let vs bleſſe God for it, and waſh our ſelues in it by the hand of ſound application.

But renouncing the puddle of our owne merits, let vs flie to Chriſts merits, the fountaine of pure waters; and let vs truſt to him alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let vs learne hence to eſteeme ſinne (as it is) to be a filthie and loathſome thing; were it not ſo, what need we to be purged? Yea, let vs eſteeme it to be a moſt capitall and hainous thing; for elſe, what needed ſuch a ſtrong purgation, as is the bloud of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this may be a remedie againſt deſpaire: for, grant thou art a great ſinner, and an old ſinner; yet thou
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10122:48"/> haſt this comfort, if thou conuert and turne, that there is ſufficient means to purge thee from thy ſinnes, though neuer ſo great, or of neuer ſo long continuance.

                  <hi>Graceleſſe perſons are not exempted from that redemption which is by Chriſt.</hi> This is a true ſaying, and worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That Chriſt Ieſus came into the world to ſaue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. whereby ſinners we are to vnderſtand as in other Texts of Scripture, graceleſſe perſons. The like we reade in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.18. The Sonne of man is come to ſeeke, and to ſaue that which was loſt. And in 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1. If any man ſinne, we haue an Aduocate with the Father, and he is the Propitiation for our ſinnes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The Lord offereth Chriſt to all, and the Goſpel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Chriſt vnto all: if any man therefore receiue not benefit by Chriſt, his condemnation is of himſelfe.

                  <hi>Graceleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are very forgetfull of Gods bleſsings, yea euen of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is ſaid of the graceleſſe Iſraelites in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.7 Our Fathers vnderſtood not thy wonders in <hi>Aegipt,</hi> they remembred not the multitude of thy mercies, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked him at the ſea, euen at the red ſea.

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of which forgetfulneſſe is, becauſe the memorie of graceleſſe perſons is vnſanctified. Our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories

                  <hi>Wherefore.</hi> Now the Apoſtle comes to a third argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby he laboureth to inforce the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and it is as though he ſhould ſay: My Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian brethren, labour to haue your hearts furniſhed with the eight fore-named graces; for if you be ſo happy as to attaine vnto them, then behold you ſhall make your calling and election ſure; yea, you ſhall ſtand, and neuer totally nor finally fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore.</hi> Before we come particularly to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of this text, we will premiſe ſomething in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, concerning vocation and election.</p>
               <p>Vocation is two fold, <hi>viz.</hi> vneffectuall and only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: or effectuall and inward. Concerning vneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling, we reade, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.24. Becauſe I haue called, and ye haue refuſed, I haue ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded, &amp;c. and <hi>Iſay</hi> 65.1.2. I ſaid, Behold me, behold me, vnto a nation that was not called by my name: I haue ſpread out my hands all the day vnto a rebellious people. And <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14. Many are called, but few are choſen.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:10122:49"/>
               <p>Now by this outward vneffectuall calling, we are to vnderſtand all the outward meanes of ſaluation; as prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, outward and temporall benefits, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, afflictions, tribulations; for by all theſe meanes, God doth call and cry aloud to all men to repent: Neuer is the word preached, the conſcience pricked, benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, and afflictions brought, but the Lord cryeth, by theſe meanes, Repent, repent. Thus the Lord hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>England</hi> and to this ſinfull citty of <hi>London,</hi> for many yeeres together; who amongſt vs can truely ſay but he hath beene called vpon, either by the word, or by his conſcience, or by benefits, or by croſſes? But we (wretches that we are) haue turned the deafe eare to God; we haue beene like the adder that ſtoppeth her eare, which refuſeth to heare the voice of the charmer, charme he neuer ſo ſweetly. How iuſtly might God forſake vs and ceaſe calling vnto vs? How iuſtly might he ſay vnto vs as he ſaith vnto the Iewes? <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.24.26. Becauſe I haue called and ye refuſed, I will alſo laugh at your calamities, and mock when your feare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</p>
               <p>Effectuall and inward calling, goeth a ſtep beyond this vneffectuall and outward: for in the effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, God doth not only afford the bare meanes of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but alſo he addeth power to the meanes, and grace to them which are called vnto, to hearken and to obey the call.</p>
               <p>The effectuall calling, is like the calling of <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the graue, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.41.42. <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth; for there was not only a bare call, but alſo a quickening power to make the call effectuall.</p>
               <p>The efficient cauſe of this effectuall calling, is God
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10122:49"/> himſelfe; it is he which calleth vs out of darkeneſſe into his marueilous light, the firſt of <hi>Peter</hi> 2.9. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede who is it that can make a dead man heare but God alone?</p>
               <p>The inſtrumentall cauſe indeede is the word of God, as appeareth, 2. <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 2.14. Whereunto he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you by our Goſpell to obtaine the glory of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And yet let vs not limit the holy One: howbeit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth moſt ordinarily call effectually, by the preaching of the word; yet we acknowledge he is able to call, and that effectually by other meanes, yea euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meanes, if it pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>The priuiledges of this calling are diuers: for firſt, hereby we are tranſlated out of the kingdome of Satan, into the kingdome of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. a greater digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then if we were taken from the dung-hill to be fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites in the kings court.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby we are called to be Saints, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. whereas, before our called eſtate, we were no better then Diuels incarnate, in our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hereby we are called to be ſonnes and daughters of God almighty, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.1.2. which is ten thouſand times a greater honour then to be called the ſonnes and daughters of Princes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, hereby we are called to be heires, yea to be coheires with Chriſt, of the kingdome of heauen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</p>

                  <hi>And election.</hi> It is the eternall and vnchangeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, whereby of his free grace and mercy, he hath made choice of ſome rather then of others, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon them eternall life and happineſſe, and that for the gloty of his free grace.</p>
               <p>That election was from all eternity, it is euident out of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. He hath choſen vs in him before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world. And that it is vnchangeable, it is as euident, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.2. God hath not caſt away his people whom he foreknew. And <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. I am thy Lord, I change not, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Againe, that election was of Gods free grace, and not of mens merits foreſeene, the Apoſtle declareth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5.6. where he tearmeth election, the election of grace; ſhewing withall, that if it be of grace, it is not of workes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that election was made to the glory of Gods free grace, it is alſo manifeſt <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10122:51"/> vs, in that our election is vnchangeable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To make your calling and election ſure.</hi> Whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue we, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is the part and duty of euery Chriſtian, to be well perſwaded and aſſured of the truth of his calling and election:</hi> of his calling, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13.5. Examine your ſelues whether you be in the faith, proue your owne ſelues: Know you not that Ieſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates? Effectuall calling is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſaluation; for vnleſſe a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. yea effectuall calling it is that which God eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth; for circumciſion auaileth nothing, nor vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but a new creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. For theſe reaſons we ought (to our power) make our calling ſure.</p>
               <p>But ſome (poſſibly) will demand, by what meanes a man or woman may be aſſured of the truth and efficacy of their calling. I anſwer: Thou maiſt know thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be true and effectual by diuers ſignes and tokens. Firſt, if it be a diuine calling, that is, if it be of God; the world hath a call, and the Diuell and Antichriſt haue a call; but the effectuall calling is from God, and hath warrant from the word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thy calling is effectuall, if being of God thou doeſt yeeld vnto it. It is not the bare call, but the yeelding vnto the call, which proueth the calling to be effectuall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If thy vocation or calling, be an euocation or calling out: If thou findeſt thy ſelfe called out of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, out of the dominion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ignorance and wickedneſſe; this is a bleſſed ſigne of effectuall calling.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:10122:52"/>
               <p>Fourthly, If thy calling be a calling to, that is, if it do not only call thee out of vice, but alſo to poſitiue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as to the practiſe of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, If thy calling be a continued calling; If thou finde that the ſame voice of God, which called thee and changed thee at the firſt, doth ſtill call vpon thee in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinance, and doth more and more goe on to change thee from one degree of grace to another.</p>
               <p>Sixtly and laſtly, If thy calling make thee fruitfull in good workes, as it did <hi>Zaccheus, Luke</hi> 19.8. The calling which procureth leaues but no fruit, is not effectuall, I dare boldly ſay. By theſe ſignes thou maiſt in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſcerne whether thy calling be effectuall or no: take ſome paines in examining of thy ſelfe in priuate, and be not partiall in thine examination.</p>
               <p>Againe, as euery Chriſtian ought to labour to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the truth of his calling, ſo in like manner he ought to be perſwaded of his election. What man is there if he heare by a flying report, that great matters are befallen vnto him, but he will enquire by all meanes whether the report be true or not? Or who is it which doth not deſire to haue deedes and euidences lying by him of his earthly poſſeſſions? Shall we be thus carefull to make our houſes and lands ſure, and ſhall we not be much more carefull to make our election and eternall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſure? Yes by all meanes.</p>
               <p>And the aſſurance of election is neceſſarie in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. Firſt, in reſpect of God. Secondly, in reſpect of our ſelues. In reſpect of God, as firſt, that we may be thankefull to his Maieſtie for the great benefit of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for how can we be thankefull vnleſſe we know that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10122:52"/> we are elected? Secondly, that we may loue God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of vs; and how is it poſſible that we ſhould loue God, vnleſſe we know that he firſt loued vs?</p>
               <p>Secondly, this aſſurance is neceſſarie in reſpect of our ſelues. For firſt, it is the ground of all ſound ioy; the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall ioy of a Chriſtian, is that his name is written in heauen, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. Now this ioy we cannot haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſurance.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, it is the eſpeciall meanes to ſuſtaine vs in our greateſt tryals. What is it which ſtayeth vs in the billowes of temptation, but the grace of our hope, if it be ſtedfaſtly ſetled?</p>
               <p>Now the markes of election are theſe, whereby we may try our ſelues in ſome meaſure.</p>
               <p>As firſt, if we finde that the word of God hath come in power vnto vs: If it hath wrought powerfully vpon our Conſciences, to change and alter vs. By this very argument <hi>Paul</hi> proueth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to be elected, in 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1.4.5. Knowing, brethren beloued, your election of God; for our Goſpell came vnto you, not in word only, but alſo in power and in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we finde that we haue faith to beleeue Gods word ſauingly, it is a marke of election; for none but they which were ordayned to eternall life beleeued, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If we finde that we are truely and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called: For indeede effectuall calling, is an effect and conſequence of election, according to that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Whom he hath predeſtinated, them he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: Now this effect doth neceſſarily proue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:10122:53"/>
               <p>Fourthly, If we finde the end of election to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in vs: For God hath choſen vs in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame, before him, in loue, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 1.4. If we finde theſe things in vs, happy are we.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if we be endued with thoſe graces ſpoken of in <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.12. Put on therefore (the elect of God, holie and beloued) bowels of mercies, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of minde, meekeneſſe, long-ſuffering, forbearing one an other, and forgiuing one another, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, if we finde that we haue grace giuen vnto vs to make choice of God to be our <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> or chiefe good. We could neuer haue grace to make choice of God, vnleſſe he had firſt made choice of vs. Not to multiply more ſignes of election: let euerie ſoule trie himſelfe by theſe, and the Lord giue a bleſſing to thy endeuours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giue diligence.</hi> Or, be diligent. Whence obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>A great deale of diligence is required for the making of calling and election ſure.</hi> And the reaſon is; firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a difficult worke; it is no eaſie matter to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly aſſured of Gods fauour without wauering. This worke hath much oppoſition; the world ſaith, it is preſumption to go about to be fully perſwaded; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell he laboureth by all meanes to weaken our faith; and laſtly, the fleſh in vs is faithleſſe and vnbeleeuing, hardly drawne to beleeue. Thus the worke is hard. Secondly, there is required, to the obtaining of aſſurance, a great deale of meanes for the working of thoſe graces where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt trie our ſelues; there is required hearing of the word, meditation in the fame, praier, conferring, and the like. And this cannot be done without diligence.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10122:53"/> Thirdly, there is required much ſifting and trying of our graces, whether they be true or no. Thoſe graces from which we muſt conclude the certaintie of our calling &amp; election, had need be ſound; &amp; therefore had need be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this triall cannot be made without ſome paines.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But ſome poſſibly will obiect, I finde it no ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter, to beleeue, that we ſhould neede to vſe anie ſuch great diligence to make our calling and election ſure: I thanke God I neuer doubted in all my life time; yea, it is pity that he ſhould liue that doth not beleeue. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Thus indeed many a wretched man deceiueth himſelfe, putting preſumption or carnall ſecuritie for faith. But let ſuch remember, He which neuer doubted, certainly neuer beleeued; if thou hadſt faith indeed, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt finde it more hard to beleeue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Yea but are not many true Conuerts able to ſay by experience, that God gaue vnto them full aſſurance of his fauour, euen from the firſt day of their conuerſion; and that their aſſurance was wrought without their own induſtrie and diligence? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I do not denie but that the Lord is able to giue aſſurance without a mans owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; and that he often times alſo doth giue it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our helpe. But no man muſt tempt the Lord in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an extraordinarie worke, conſidering the Lord affordeth ordinarie meanes. God once gaue Manna vnto the children of Iſrael: but this doth not proue that others may expect the ſame in after-times. Yea whoſo expecteth bread at theſe dayes, he muſt labour for it, and not looke that it ſhould ſtill fall from heauen: euen ſo, if we deſire full aſſurance of Gods fauour, we muſt be diligent in ſeeking of it, and not expect it by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie meanes. Secondly, euen they which finde the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10122:54"/> greateſt aſſurance, yet (no doubt) they find diuerſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of Satan betweene times, ſhaking their aſſurance, and breeding doubts; which doubtings will not be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againe without diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This point ſerueth firſt, iuſtly to reproue ſuch as vſe no diligence this way; yea as thinke it to be curioſitie and niceneſſe for anie man to giue diligence to make his calling and election ſure. And the ſinne of ſuch is the greater, becauſe they will vſe all diligence to get riches, to obtaine their luſts, to haue their wills, and the like; but they haue no diligence to ſpare for God, or for their owne ſaluation. I exhort ſuch to repent of their former negligence this way, and to redeeme the time with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence for hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let euerie man and woman ſtirre vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to this diligence, <hi>viz.</hi> to make their calling and election ſure. It is worth all our paines; for, what can be more ſweet to the ſoule, then to be fully perſwaded of Gods fauour? Neglect not ſuch a comfort.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſidering that full aſſurance is not attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ordinarily, but by great diligence; therefore let ſuch as haue obtained it more eaſily, try their aſſurance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſound or no. And if they finde it to be ſound, let them be more thankefull to God, who hath giuen that freely vnto them, without their owne labour, which he giueth not vnto many others, but with much ſtriuing and induſtrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore the rather.</hi> Theſe words haue reſpect to that in the latter end of this tenth verſe, where it is ſaid: <hi>For if ye do theſe things, yee ſhall neuer fall.</hi> The point to be obſerued is this; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the part and duty of euerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the rather to be diligent to make his calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10122:54"/> ſure, becauſe this is a meanes to preuent falling away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay, How is full aſſurance of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and calling, a meanes to preuent falling away? I anſwer, Becauſe it is ioyned with many preſeruatiue graces, as with faith, and the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe, ſuch is the ſweetneſſe of full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that whoſoeuer hath it, he would not part with it againe for anie pleaſure or profit, whereby he is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fall away. Thus aſſurance is a ſtrong preſeruatiue againſt backeſliding.</p>
               <p>But wherein ſtandeth the force of this Argument, which the holie Ghoſt vſeth to perſwade euerie man to make his calling and election ſure? For, is it ſuch a great matter to fall away, that we ſhould the rather giue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make our calling and election ſure, to preuent it? Surely yes, it is a ſore matter and grieuous for anie to backeſlide, or to play the apoſtate. If anie man draw backe (ſaith God) my ſoule ſhall haue no pleaſure in him, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 10.38. Yea, it had bene better for them not to haue knowne the way of righteouſneſſe, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue knowne it, to turne from the holie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement giuen vnto them, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon that backeſliding is ſo fearefull, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: firſt, becauſe it fruſtrateth or maketh vaine all former good beginnings; for the righteouſneſſe of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders ſhall not once be mentioned, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.24. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe it giueth a ſtronger poſſeſſion vnto the diuell then euer he had before: he re-enters with ſeuen diuels worſe then himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45. Thirdly, becauſe it maketh a man or woman more like vnto dogges and ſwine then Chriſtians; The dog is returned to his vomit, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:10122:55"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerueth to ſhew the reaſon or cauſe, why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fall off at theſe daies; it is becauſe they neuer were diligent to make their calling and election ſure. If they had laboured for aſſurance, their aſſurance would haue preuented their fall. They ſhould haue ſtood by faith; whereas now they beare the price of their follie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if ye do theſe things.</hi> Or, as it is in the originall: <hi>Doing theſe things ye ſhall neuer fall.</hi> Now in that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth ſeeme to intimate, that our ſtanding is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, and that it dependeth (in ſome ſort) vpon our owne endeuours: <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> therefore the queſtion may be this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the childe of God, elected before all worlds, redeemed with the bloud of Chriſt, and truly and effectually called, may euer totally and finally fall out of his election, redemption and vocation, and ſo become reprobate and be damned; and whether his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding depend mainly vpon his owne endeuours? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> We do not deny but that hypocrites, which ſeeme to be the children of God, and are not; and ſeeme to haue ſauing grace, but haue not, may finally and totally fall from that which ſeemeth to haue bene in them in former times: as we ſee in the examples of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> and many others. And the reaſon of their fall is: firſt, becauſe they beganne in hypocriſie, and that profeſſion which is begunne in hypocriſie, will commonly end in apoſtacie. Secondly, becauſe they neuer receiued the truth, or embraced profeſſion for it ſelfe, or in the loue of it, but meerly for carnall ends, as for profit, or a great name, or to pleaſe others, and the like. And that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion which is vndertaken for ſuch cauſes, muſt needes ceaſſe, when the cauſes of it ceaſſe. Thirdly, becauſe they were neuer any practiſers of the word of God.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10122:55"/> They alwayes built vpon the ſandie foundation of an outward profeſſion, making no conſcience of ſound practiſe: and therefore, when the raine deſcended, and the flouds came, and the windes blew and beat vpon them, they fell, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.26.27.</p>
               <p>Againe, we do not denie but that the verie children of God may fall, in ſome meaſure, from ſome degree of that grace which they haue had in former times. They may fall into great errors of iudgement, as we ſee in the holie <hi>Galatians,</hi> which were ready to embrace another goſpel; yea which were remoued to another goſpel, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> 1.6. Secondly, they may fall from their firſt loue in ſome degree, <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 2.4.5. Thirdly, they may fall into groſſe ſinne, as we ſee in <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Fourthly, they may fall from the ſence and feeling of Gods grace; and they may come to thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be reprobates and caſt-awaies, to be vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of grace, and the like.</p>
               <p>The reaſons of which downe-falls in Gods children are diuers: firſt, want or neglect of powerfull meanes. What was the reaſon of the fall of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> but <hi>Paules</hi> abſence? Secondly, idleneſſe; for, how came <hi>Dauid</hi> to fall ſo groſſely, but in that he was found idle? 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. Thirdly, bad companie. For, how came <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to denie his Maiſter, but by being amongſt the high prieſts ſeruants? <hi>Math.</hi> 26. Fourthly, naturall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we being too prone to feare men, and ſo to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by their threats and perſecutions; or to pleaſe them, and ſo to yeeld vnto them in all things; or to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their guiſe or example. Theſe, and ſuch like, are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the fall of Gods children from ſome degrees of grace.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:10122:56"/>
               <p>But that Gods children once elected, redeemed and effectually called, ſhould vtterly and finally fall, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly denie it; and that for theſe reaſons: firſt, becauſe God hath expreſly promiſed, that he will make with his ſeruants an euerlaſting Couenant; and that he will not turne from them to do them good, but that he will put his feare in their hearts, that they may not depart from him, <hi>Ieremy</hi> 32.40. Now Gods promiſes are infallible. Secondly, becauſe our marriage with Chriſt is an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting marriage: I will betroth thee vnto me for euer, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.19. Now that which is for euer, ſhall neuer haue end. Thirdly, becauſe the Father is ſtronger then all, and none can plucke vs out of his hand, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.28. Fourthly, becauſe God will neuer caſt away anie whom he knew before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall obiect that in <hi>Exodus</hi> 32, 33; If anie ſhall ſinne againſt me, or whoſoeuer ſinneth againſt me, him will I blot out of my booke: I anſwer, The Lord ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth there figuratiuely, and to our capacities; and his meaning is, that he wil manifeſt rebels not to be written in his booke: that whereas they ſeemed to be the elect people of God, by outward prerogatiues and externall profeſſion, now the Lord will demonſtrate them to be of the Synagogue of Satan. This muſt needes be the meaning of the holie Ghoſt in that place. For where he ſpeaketh particularly concerning Gods decrees, he ſhewes, that they are immutable, that they are like the mighty mountains which ſtand faſt for euer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.21. <hi>The counſell of the Lord ſhall ſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the ſecond part of the queſtion, to wit, Whether a childe of God ſtand mainly by his owne endeuours or not? becauſe it is ſaid; If yee do theſe things, yee ſhall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10122:56"/> neuer fall: I anſwer, He that made vs without vs, will not ſaue vs without vs. We muſt worke out our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.12. ſo that our endeuours are required in this buſineſſe. Howbeit it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. We muſt worke, but we ſtand not mainly by our owne worke, but we are kept by the power of God, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh in his firſt Epiſtle the firſt chapter. Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe indeede is an excellent meanes to preuent the fall, as we ſhall ſhew when we come to the Doctrine; but it is not the maine. We haue an higher cauſe of ſtanding then our owne endeuours, to wit, the diuine power; or elſe we ſhould quickely fall, for anie thing we are able to do by our beſt induſtrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye doe theſe things ye ſhall neuer fall.</hi> The doctrine hence to be obſerued, is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Practiſe of Gods word, and adding grace vnto grace, is an eſpeciall meanes to preuent backe-ſliding.</hi> And that practiſe is an eſpeciall meanes to preuent back-ſliding, it is manifeſt out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24: Whoſoeuer heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him to a wiſe man, which built his houſe vpon a rock; and the raynes deſcended, and the flouds came, and the windes blew, and beate vpon that houſe, and it fell not, for it was founded vpon a Rock.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that adding grace vnto grace, is likewiſe a meanes to preuent back-ſliding, it is euident: for theſe words in the Text, <hi>If ye doe theſe things ye ſhall neuer fall,</hi> haue relation to that which goeth before in the fift, ſixt, and ſeuenth verſes of this Chapter; where we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to adde grace vnto grace: which if we doe, we haue bore a promiſe, we ſhall neuer fall. Grace is of a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10122:57"/> power, yea it is the armour of a Chriſtian: Faith is a ſhield, Righteouſneſſe is a breſtplate, Hope is an helmet, Truth is a warlike girdle, Courage is warlike bootes or leg-harneſſe: as they are compared, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. Now therefore to adde grace vnto grace muſt needs be a meanes to preuent back-ſliding.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerues to diſcry vnto vs, the reaſon that ſo many carnall Goſpellers fall off or goe back from their former true profeſſion; it is becauſe howſoeuer they can talke of religion, and diſcourſe of godlineſſe, yet they doe not practiſe it; if they did turne their talke into practiſe, they ſhould ſtand more firmly then they doe.</p>
               <p>2. This ſhews the very cauſe why many of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do fall from the firſt forwardneſſe; it is partly want of practiſe, and partly want of adding grace vnto grace.</p>
               <p>Many of the children of God, for want of practiſe and adding grace vnto grace, doe fall into thoſe ſinnes, which others of Gods ſeruants neuer fall into, being more pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall; and more carefull to adde grace vnto grace. Therefore as any of vs deſire to preuent apoſtaſie in our ſelues, let vs be admoniſhed to practiſe and increaſe in grace, at the leaſt let vs vſe our beſt endeuors thereunto. If we doe theſe things, it reſts vpon Gods fidelitie that we ſhall neuer f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>An entrance into the euerlaſting kingdome.</hi> Now we are come to the fourth and laſt argument, whereby the former exhortation concerning adding grace vnto grace, is preſſed and vrged. Wherein firſt we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt hath a kingdome:</hi> For here, as you ſee, is made mention of it, and for the ſame cauſe is he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a king, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9: Behold thy king commeth vnto thee; and in many other places. Now the kingdome of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10122:57"/> Chriſt is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> the kingdome of grace, and the kingdome of glory. Concerning the kingdome of grace we reade, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. where it is ſaid That God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs out of the power of darkeneſſe, and tranſlated vs into the kingdome of his deere Sonne, that is, into the kingdome of grace. And this kingdome of grace is exerciſed in the hearts of men, in righteouſneſſe, and peace and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. the lawes thereof being the word of God, which is the word of the kingdome; the ſubiects, all the elect which are effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called and regenerate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as Chriſt hath a kingdome of grace, ſo he hath a kingdome of glory; according to that of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent theefe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.40. Lord remember me when thou commeſt into thy kingdome, that is, into thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory. And this kingdome is not exerciſed as the former, by the word and diſcipline; but immediatly, as ſeemeth to be intimated, <hi>Reu.</hi> 7.17. where it is ſaid that the Lambe doth leade vnto the liuing fountaines of waters. Where, by waters (I take it) is meant waters of comfort: and by leading, an immediate worke of Chriſt. Now the ſubiects of this kingdome of glory are, not only the Saints, according to that in <hi>Reu.</hi> 14.1. I ſaw a Lambe ſtanding vpon mount Sion; but alſo the very Angels; for ſo much the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply in his firſt epiſtle, 3.22. Who is gone (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt) and is on the right hand of God; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells and authorities and powers being made ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which bewrayeth the blindneſſe of the Iewes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing Chriſt for his meaneneſſe, not knowing indeede his greatneſſe: they take notice of his croſſe, but not of his Crowne.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:10122:58"/>
               <p>Secondly, let it teach vs to ſubmit our ſelues to Chriſt as to our king; Let vs obey him in the kingdome of grace, that at the laſt we may liue with him in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Into the euerlaſting kingdome.</hi> The next point hence to be obſerued is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The kingdome of Chriſt is not a temporary, but an euerlaſting kingdome.</hi> It is not for a certaine time, but for euer. It is not for a moment, but for eternity. He ſhall reigne ouer the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> for euer, and of his kingdome there ſhall be no end, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33. The Lord is the true God, he is the liuing God, and the euerlaſting king, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.10. Thy throne ô God, is for euer and euer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.6. And euery creature which is in heauen and on the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I ſaying; Bleſſing, honour and glory, and power, be vnto him that ſitteth vpon the Throne, and vnto the Lamb for euer and euer, <hi>Reu.</hi> 5.13. The which places do ſufficiently proue the eternity of Chriſts kingdome, or that his kingdome is an euerlaſting kingdome; <hi>Daniel</hi> the ſeuenth Chapter, the thirteenth and fourteenth verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeede we muſt not thinke that Chriſt ſhall loſe any of his dignity or greatneſſe at any time, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he is ouer all, God, bleſſed for euer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. He neuer ceaſeth to deſerue a kingdome, becauſe his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is euerlaſting; and neuer groweth vnſufficient to manage a kingdome, becauſe for euer he is very God. Therefore it were very iniurious for vs to thinke that his kingdome were not euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But yet ſome may (poſſibly) obiect, that in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. where it is ſaid of Chriſt, that he muſt reigne till he hath put all his enemies vnder his feete: and in verſe 28.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10122:58"/> When all things ſhall be ſubdued vnto him, then ſhall the Sonne alſo himſelfe, bee ſubiect vnto him that put all things vnder him. Therefore it might ſeeme that Chriſts kingdome ſhall only continue till the day of iudgement, and that it ſhall then be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I take it, that the bleſſed Apoſtle meaneth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts kingdome in that place, to wit, that Chriſt after the day of iudgement ſhall not rule his Church by the preaching of the word and the like: But as for the matter of the kingdome, that it ſhall continue for euer, and that Chriſt as God ſhall reigne with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt for euer. Other anſweres might be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, but in my poore vnderſtanding I hold this to be ſufficient for the clearing of the Apoſtles meaning: if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man thinke otherwiſe, let him enioy his owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I will not contend with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let the conſideration then of Chriſts euerlaſting kingdome, firſt, be a meanes to teach Chriſtians to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the excellency of Chriſt. He reigneth; and (for the matter) he ſhall reigne for euer. Let vs haue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of any future abaſement oſ Chriſt. Let vs not thinke that he ſhall at any time be dethroned or thruſt from his dignity. His kingdome is an euerlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it be matter of comfort to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Chriſt our eldeſt brother ſhall reigne for euer; therefore as brethren reioyce, that it ſhould alwaies goe well with their brother, euen ſo ought we to reioyce that it ſhall alwaies goe well with Chriſt. We doe but in this loue Chriſt, becauſe he loued vs firſt; he reioyceth in our proſperity; therefore why ſhould not we reioyce in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10122:59"/> his glory and the eternity of it? Yea, it may be matter of comfort vnto Gods children; being coheires with Chriſt they ſhall be partakers of an euerlaſting kingdome, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An entrance.</hi> Whence obſerue we, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath an entrance.</hi> Yea his kingdome of grace hath an entrance, as well as the kingdome of glorie; as euery houſe hath a doore whereby the family do enter: and as euerie Citie hath gates whereby the citizens and others haue their ingreſſe and egreſſe: So it is with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, it hath its ingreſſe or entrance. And this ingreſſe or entrance into Chriſts kingdome, it is like the entrance into a Citie by gates. For ſo it is compared, <hi>Reu.</hi> 21.13. where the holie Citie is ſaid to haue twelue gates, three on the northſide, three on the ſouth, three on the weſt, and three on the eaſt. Whereby we are to vnderſtand eſpecially the eſtate of the Church here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, being indeede the kingdome of Chriſt, into the which there be many gates or in lets.</p>
               <p>Now the entrance into this kingdome, is no eaſie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; for indeede the gate is ſtraite, as Chriſt himſelf ſaith of it, in <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24. and it is ſaid to be ſtraite; Firſt, becauſe there is ſo much oppoſition to keepe vs from entring in; the world, the fleſh, and the Diuell, will not haue vs to enter into this City, if all their power can keepe vs back. Secondly, it is ſaid to be ſtraite, becauſe it leadeth to an holy ſtrictneſſe. After we are entred into this holy City or kingdome, we muſt not thinke to liue looſely as in former times, but we muſt come to a more ſtrict courſe of life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid to be ſtraite, in reſpect that it will not giue entrance to any that hath a purpoſe in his heart
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10122:59"/> to continue in his dearling and boſome ſinnes. Vnleſſe the proud perſon will ſtoope, he ſhall not enter here. Vnleſſe the vain-glorious perſon abate of his ſwelling, this gate is too ſtraite for him. Vnleſſe the couetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be content to lay downe his burthen of ill got goods and monies, this doore will not receiue him. Vnleſſe the luxurious perſon ceaſe to embrace his harlot, the gate of Chriſt his kingdome is too narrow to receiue both him and his harlot at once, being both impenitent and graceleſſe perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Thus we ſee there is an entrance into Chriſt his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and what kinde of entrance it is. Let it teach vs to be thankefull to God, who hath giuen vnto man an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vnto grace and glory. The Lord hath not dealt ſo with the Angels that fell, but hath vtterly caſt them out of his kingdome of grace and glory, and left them no entrance at all, nor hope or poſſibilitie of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it teach vs not to be diſcouraged, though we finde the entrance into grace to be ſtraite; if we be content to endure the ſtraiteneſſe of the entrance, Chriſt will make our progreſſe in grace to be the more eaſie, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.30.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let it teach vs to be content to lay aſide all impediments which might hinder our entrance. Let vs caſt off euery thing that preſſeth downe; and let vs ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſtriue to enter into this ſtraite gate: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs ſo doe, becauſe without this City there is no ſaluation. For without ſhall be dogges, &amp;c. <hi>Reuelation</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall be miniſtred.</hi> That is, ſhall be yeelded by God himſelfe: Whence we are to note, that <hi>men and women
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10122:60"/> doe not enter this gate of grace by their owne power, but by Gods power.</hi> They doe not miniſter an entrance vnto themſelues, but it is miniſtred vnto them by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Who was it that opened the doore of Faith to the Gentiles, but God himſelfe? <hi>Acts</hi> 14.27. Who was it that opened a wide doore vnto <hi>Paules</hi> miniſtery to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come effectuall and to doe good, but God? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.4. Who was it that opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but the ſame God? <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeede our hearts are ſhut vp, or faſt locked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally. We are ſhut vp vnto Faith, as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. Now as a lock cannot open it ſelfe, no more can our hearts without the key of Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But here ſome (poſſibly) may obiect: If it be not in our power to enter in at the ſtraite gate, then why doth the Lord bid vs to ſtriue to enter in? Shall we thinke that the Lord would haue vs to ſtriue in vaine?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Though our entrance is not mainly procured by our ſtriuing; yet our ſtriuing, through the mercy of God, ſhall not be in vaine. For God may giue a bleſſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, yea ſuch a bleſſing, as that it may become a meanes of our entrance, though not the efficient cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Now is it ſo, that it is God that miniſtreth entrance into the kingdome of grace, then this muſt teach all that haue found entrance, to be thankefull to God, who hath ſhewed this mercy on them. If God had not opened the doore, heere had beene no entrance at all for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let this teach vs, that if we would finde more and more an entrance to be ſupplied vnto vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10122:60"/> we may enter farther and farther into this bleſſed kingdome of grace; then we muſt pray vnto God that he would giue vs this ſupply. It is he which openeth the gate at the firſt; and it is he that doth open it wider and wider by degrees: as the greeke word alſo in this Text tranſlated, Miniſtred, doth ſignifie, Shall be ſupplied by degrees.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let vs, whileſt God doth hold open this gate of mercy, ſtriue to enter in; leſt wilfully refuſing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when we might, we prouoke the Lord to ſhut vp the gate, and neuer to be entreated to open againe vnto vs. Take heede of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abundantly.</hi> Or as the word ſignifieth in the greeke, richly: whence we may note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>There be degrees in this matter of entrance into the kingdome of grace.</hi> Some are entred farther then others be; ſome finde a rich entrance and abundant, others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ot altogether ſo. Thus the Prophets and Apoſtles were further entred into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of knowledge, then any ordinary Chriſtian there was. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was brought into more familiaritie with God then many of his brethren, in that the Lord talked with him, as a man with his friend. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> was led into more rauiſhing ioy, then many others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rapt vp into the third heauen.</p>
               <p>And thus at theſe dayes, many haue made a greater progreſſe in Religion then others haue.</p>
               <p>And what is the reaſon of this difference? Surely the firſt and principall cauſe thereof is this, <hi>viz.</hi> the mercy of God and his wiſedome: To one in his wiſedome and mercy he giueth the degree of grace which he will not giue to another.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe of the difference is, becauſe many
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10122:61"/> are too remiſſe and negligent in the ſeeking of grace they will not take the paines that others doe in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of grace, and therefore it is no marueile if like vnto trewants they come ſhort in their learning.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this teach vs to labour to get more rich entrance; let vs not content our ſelues that we haue an entrance, but let vs endeuour to grow rich in grace. Let vs ſtriue to goe further and further in Chriſt his kingdome: We may goe farre in this kingdome, euen in this life, if we be carefull to vſe the meanes as we ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For ſo.</hi> That is, by adding grace vnto grace, you ſhall more and more finde entrance into Chriſt his kingdom: for this verſe hath relation to that which went before in the fift, ſixth and ſeauenth verſes, in this ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Hence we are to note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>By the eight forenamed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, an entrance is made into the kingdome of Chriſt, and by the growth in thoſe graces, an abundant entrance is more and more ſupplied.</hi> Thus by knowledge we are entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the light of Chriſt his kingdome, and by increaſe in knowledge, we are led into greater light. Thus by Faith we are brought to the preſence and fellowſhip of Chriſt, and as our Faith groweth, we increaſe in that fellowſhip. Thus by godlineſſe, we are brought to the ſubiection and obedience which is in Chriſt his kingdome; and the more we abound in godlineſſe, the further we make entrance into the kingdome. Thus by loue, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and patience, we are entred into the temper of Chriſts kingdome, and the ſweete affections that are exerciſed therein; and the more that we increaſe in theſe bleſſed graces, the further we enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:10122:61"/>
               <p>Laſtly, by Charitie, that is, by workes of mercy, we are brought into the practiſe of the kingdome; and the more that we grow in theſe workes, the further we enter into the kingdome: the like may be ſaid of vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Wouldeſt thou then enter and go farre in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt; then labour to go farre in the eight forenamed graces, content not thy ſelfe till thou haſt theſe graces in thee: and when thou haſt them, labour to growe in them. And thus an entrance ſhall be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred abundantly into the euerlaſting kingdome of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. Which if thou findeſt, happy, and thrice happy art thou.</p>

            <div n="12" type="verse">
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore.</hi> Now we come to the third generall part of the Chapter, wherein the Apoſtle declareth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which moued him to write; from the beginning of this twelfth verſe, vnto the end of the fifteenth: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the reaſons which ſhould moue the Church to heare him, and to hearken vnto him; from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſixteenth verſe vnto the end of the Chapter. The reaſons which moue him to write, are, firſt, that he might excuſe himſelfe from negligence; which is a foule fault in a Miniſter, verſe 12. Secondly, from the fitneſſe of the practiſe, verſe 13. Thirdly, from the conſideration of the ſhortneſſe of his owne life, verſe 14. Fourthly, from the conſideration of the vtility of his writings in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, verſe 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore.</hi> In this twelfth verſe, two points: firſt, the pleading of a cauſe: ſecondly, the remouing of an obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I will not be negligent; or, as the word in the originall is, I will not be careleſſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt point hence to be obſerued, is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10122:62"/> great fault in a Miniſter to be careleſſe and negligent.</hi> Elſe the Apoſtle would not thus excuſe himſelfe from that imputation. And for the further euidencing of the truth of this point, I referre the Reader to the 34. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> 2.3.4.5.6. where it is ſaid; Woe vnto the Shepheards of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that feede themſelues: ſhould not the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards feede the flockes? Ye feed vpon the fat, and ye clothe you with the wooll. Ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the flocke. The diſeaſed haue ye not ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened; neither haue ye healed that which was ſicke; neither haue ye bound vp that which was broken; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue ye brought againe that which was driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; neither haue yee ſought out that which was loſt. And againe in the ſixt verſe: My ſheep wandered tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all the mountaines, and vpon euerie high hill: yea, my flock was ſcattered vpon all the face of the earth, and none did ſearch or ſeek after them. In all which the holy Ghoſt doth ſeuerely taxe careleſſe negligent miniſters. The like we reade, <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.10. where the Lord taxeth the dumbe dogges for their ſleeping, and delighting in ſleep, that is, for their remiſneſſe and negligence in their calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And certainly, it muſt needes be a great ſinne in a Miniſter, to be careleſſe and negligent, becauſe his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment concerneth the very ſoules of men. It is a ſin in a ſhepheard, not to looke carefully to his ſheepe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the life of the creature is in his hand: but it is a greater ſinne for a Miniſter not to looke carefully to his flocke, becauſe the ſoules of his people are in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which may ſerue, iuſtly to reprooue all careleſſe and negligent Miniſters, which looke narrowly to the fleece, but ſtarue the flocke. So they may haue the pay, they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10122:62"/> care not what becomes of the ſoules; let them ſinke or ſwimme, ſo that they may haue their skinnes, all is well. Theſe are worſe then the King of <hi>Sodome, Geneſis</hi> 14.21. For he ſaid vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Giue me the ſoules, and take thou the goods to thy ſelfe: but theſe ſay to the diuell, Giue me the goods, &amp; take thou the ſoules to thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may ſerue alſo iuſtly to reproue many which thinke the worſe of their Miniſters euen for their carefulneſſe &amp; diligence. How many Miniſters be there at theſe daies, that fare the worſe for their painfulnes? if they would be more negligent, they ſhould be better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed. Oh vaine people! conſider if a Miniſter be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and induſtrious in his place, he doth no more then God doth require of him as a duty. Shall God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it as a duty, and ſhall man dare to ſay, It is more then needs?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let people animate and encourage their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to this carefulneſſe: let them be carefull to heare, as he muſt be carefull to preach; yea, let them miniſter vnto him in all good things. An excellent worke ought to haue an excellent reward. People muſt not be like vnto <hi>Pharaoes</hi> taskers, which exact a great number of brickes, but thinke much to allow ſtraw; but they muſt remember that the labourer is worthy of his hire, as our bleſſed Sauiour ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore.</hi> This hath relation to that which goeth before in the former verſe. And it is as though the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had ſaid: Foraſmuch as by grace an entrance is made into the euerlaſting Kingdome of Chriſt, and this grace is wrought ordinarily by the meanes of the word, wherefore I will not be negligent, &amp;c. </p>
               <p>Whence we are to note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It ought to be an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10122:63"/> motiue vnto a Miniſter, to be carefull and diligent in his calling, becauſe he may be a meanes, by his diligence, to bring ſoules into Chriſts kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the very argument which <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth to excite <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> to be diligent to preach the word, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; becauſe in ſo doing he ſhall both ſaue him ſelfe, and them that heare him, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>And if any ſhall demand, What good a Miniſter ſhall reape, if he be vſed by the Spirit of God, as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in adding ſoules to Chriſts Kingdome: I anſwer in the words of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. They that turne many to righteouſneſſe ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres, for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Therefore the motiue ſhould be very forcible with vs Miniſters, to make vs diligent in preaching and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe hereby many ſoules may be entred into the euerlaſting kingdome of our Lord and Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. It is a good ſeruice by naturall generation to increaſe the world; but it is a farre better ſeruice to be a meanes to increaſe the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To put you in remembrance of theſe things.</hi> Whence obſerue we, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is the office of the Miniſter, to put peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in remembrance of thoſe things which pertaine to the kingdome of God.</hi> For this cauſe Gods Miniſters are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Gods remembrancers; for ſo I take it, the Hebrue word is beſt rendred, <hi>Eſay</hi> 62.6.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Apoſtle doth directly enioyne <hi>Titus</hi> in the third of that epiſtle, the firſt verſe, that he ſhould put the Church of the <hi>Cretians</hi> in minde; or, as it is in the Greeke text, that he ſhould remember them to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Principalities and Powers; intimating thereby, that it is the Miniſters duty, to be a remembrancer.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:10122:63"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which plainely ſheweth what a ſhort memory we haue in the beſt things, in that we need a remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers helpe. We can eaſily remember wrongs done vnto vs; or, we can remember with facilitie what belongs to our worldly gaine. Commonly we neede no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer in theſe matters. But if it come to matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods kingdome, herein we are dull, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remember any thing, vnleſſe we be oftentimes put in minde of the ſame. For this we ought to be humbled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though ye know them.</hi> Obſerue we here from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the diſperſed Church of God, vnto whom <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> writeth, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the part and duty of euery true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be well acquainted with the Scriptures or word of God.</hi> Hence it is that Chriſt ſaith, Search the Scriptures, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. Hence it is alſo that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16. Thus it was the commendation of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he knew the Scriptures of a childe, 2. <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.15: And of <hi>Apollos,</hi> that he was mighty in the Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 18 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeed, ignorance of the Scriptures is carefully to be auoided: firſt, becauſe it is the meanes of falling into many groſſe and dangerous errours; according to that in <hi>Math.</hi> 22.29. You do erre not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Secondly, becauſe, to be ignorant now in theſe dayes of knowledge, it is the marke of a reprobate or caſt-away; according to that in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. If our Goſpel be now hid, it is hid to them which are loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which doctrine ſerueth iuſtly to condemne the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Pope, which debarreth the people from the reading of the Scriptures. God would haue people to know the Scriptures: and the Pope would haue the people ignorant of the Scriptures. O man of ſinne! how
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:10122:64"/> great is thy preſumption, which dareſt forbid that which God hath commanded?</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may iuſtly condemne the ignorance of theſe times wherein we liue; for howbeit we haue plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preaching, yet how many thouſands be there which liue ignorant, not knowing the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let it ſerue to ſtirre vp euery one of vs to be more ſtudious in the word of God: Let vs abandon all vaine and wicked bookes out of our houſes, and let vs get euery one a Bible, and let vs reade therein day and night.</p>

                  <hi>And be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Whence obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not ſufficient to know the truth, but we ought to be eſtabliſhed in it.</hi> Hereupon it is ſaid, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.6. As ye haue therefore receiued Chriſt Ieſus the Lord, ſo walke in him, rooted and built vp, and eſtabliſhed in the faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe alſo ſerueth that in <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4.14. That we hence forth be no more children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with euety winde of doctrine by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſſe wherby they lie in wait to deceiue.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian muſt not halt betweene two opinions, as Iſrael did, 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.21. neither muſt he be luke warme as the Laodiceans, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.16. but he muſt be ſtedfaſt, vnmoueable, &amp;c. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which may ſerue iuſtly to reprooue many in our daies, who howſoeuer they yeelde a kinde of generall conſent to the truth, yet they are not ſetled nor eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in it: inſomuch, that if they ſhall be ſet vpon by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cunning deceiuer, they are quickely carried away. How many be there at theſe daies, that are as indifferent for Popery as for the trueth? O my brethren, what a

               <p>Secondly, let this ſerue to excite euery one of vs to be more throughly ſetled in the truth; and that we may be ſo, let vs take theſe directions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let vs labour to be able to yeeld a reaſon of our faith, and to know the grounds of that which we hold. What is the reaſon that many go away? Euen becauſe they know not the grounds of that truth which they hold.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let vs follow the truth in loue; a man is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remoued from that which he loues: and ſo if we could loue the truth, and be inflamed with it, certainely we ſhould not be eaſily turned from it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt obſerue thoſe which are giuen to ſects and ſchiſmes, which ſeeke to vnſettle men in their faith, and we muſt auoide them. Let vs neuer thinke to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Religion, ſo long as we giue entertainment to ſchiſmaticall perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We muſt pray vnto God to ſettle and eſtabliſh vs. It is his worke to make a ſtable ſoule; according to that in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. But the God of all grace, who hath called vs into his eternall glorie by Chriſt Ieſus after that yee haue ſuffered a while, make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, ſettle you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the preſent truth.</hi> Marke here; the Apoſtle doth not ſay, In the preſent truths, as ſpeaking of many; but, In the preſent truth, as ſpeaking of one.</p>
               <p>Whence we may gather, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>There is but one truth, howſoeuer there may be many opinions concerning that truth.</hi> Hence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. There is one faith; which is meant, as well of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:10122:65"/> or ground of faith, as of the habit or worke of it: and the reaſon of this point is, becauſe there is but one God who is the author of it.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which may teach vs to bewaile the multiplicitie of opinions in the world; ſome ſauouring of Poperie, ſome of Anabaptiſme, ſome of Arminianiſme, ſome of Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, ſome of Mahometiſme, ſome of Iewiſme, ſome of Paganiſme, ſome of Atheiſme, and the like; and yet there is but one truth. But let none be diſcoraged for all this; let vs remember what Chriſt told vs before-hand: It cannot be auoided but that offences will come, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the preſent truth.</hi> Or, as it is in the originall, in the truth that now is. Whence obſerue this doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That as there is but one truth, ſo <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>That is that one truth which was preached and profeſſed by the holy Apoſtles in the Primitiue Church.</hi> Hence it is that it is ſaid in <hi>Galat.</hi> 18. Though we, or an Angel from heauen preach any other goſpel vnto you, then that which we haue preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, let him be accurſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> The Primitiue truth was preached by immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation: and it was confirmed by miracles, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any truth was ſince.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which ſerueth to diſcouer the vnſoundneſſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie; for the inuentions of Poperie were no part of that truth which was eſtabliſhed in the Primitiue Church, but rather contrary to that ancient truth. The Papiſts complaine of our nouiliſme, or new-fangleneſſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but we may a great deale more iuſtly complaine of their new-fangleneſſe in Religion; for we hold to the ancient truth, taught and profeſſed in the Apoſtles times: whereas they are remoued to another goſpell,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10122:65"/> and haue coyned new articles of Faith, which were not part of the ancient grounded truth taught by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though ye know.</hi> Whence we may note that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a Miniſter to teach or to write as well thoſe things which are vulgar, and well knowne, as thoſe things which are rare, or leſſe knowne.</hi> Thus we reade in 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.21. I write theſe things, not becauſe ye know not the truth, but becauſe ye know it. And <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1. It grieueth me not to write the ſame things vnto you, but for you it is ſafe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> We are not ſo ſharpe witted in heauenly things, but we haue neede of much inculcation to cauſe vs to vnderſtand; neither are we ſo forward to practiſe, but we neede to be excited thereunto againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Which ſerueth iuſtly to taxe all ſuch Miniſters as think that they neuer preach or write well, vnleſſe they inuent and broach ſome new-fangle conceit of their owne idle inuention: as though knowne truth were growne too ſtale for their mouthes to vtter. But let ſuch know, that better ſchollers then themſelues, I meane the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, did not ſcorne to preach and to write and to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate knowne truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth to reproue multitudes of people, which, hauing itching eares, loathe the knowne truth, and Athenian-like, deſire after nouelties. But let ſuch know, that they had more neede to haue that which they know to be beate vpon their conſciences, that they may beleeue and practiſe it, then to luſt after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this may ſerue to iuſtifie the practiſe of ſuch
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10122:66"/> faithfull Miniſters which inculcate and beate vpon knowne truth, chooſing rather to profit then to pleaſe. But to leaue this verſe and to come to the next, which is the ſecond argument, and is taken from the equity of the practiſe.</p>

                  <hi>A meete thing,</hi> or as it is in the Greeke, <hi>A iuſt thing.</hi> Whence obſerue we this doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods word is not an vniuſt, but a iuſt practiſe.</hi> And that firſt, in reſpect of God. Secondly, in reſpect of the Church of God. Thirdly, in reſpect of the word it ſelfe. In reſpect of God: Firſt, becauſe God requires it as a duty of Miniſters to preach the word, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. And he commanded vs to preach vnto the people, and to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, &amp;c. Now whatſoeuer God requireth as a dutie, muſt needes be iuſt. Secondly, the preaching of Gods word, maketh for Gods glory, and therefore is termed the Goſpell of the glory of the bleſſed God; for ſo the words are in the originall, in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11. Now whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer tendeth to Gods glory immediately, muſt needes be iuſt and meete. If any ſhall demand how the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word doth tend to Gods glory; I anſwere: firſt, becauſe it maketh his excellency knowne. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it ſets forth his prayſe. Thirdly, becauſe it ſubiecteth the world vnto him: in all which God is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to preach Gods word, is a iuſt thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Church, for it is the meanes of her conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Nineuie</hi> repented at the preaching of <hi>Ionas, Math.</hi> 12.41. Secondly, it is a meanes of her daily repaſt or nouriſhment: The lips of the righteous feede many, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.21.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the meanes of her ſaluation: for it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10122:66"/> God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſaue them which beleeue, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. Now how iuſt and meete a thing is it, that the Church of God ſhould enioy that meanes which is of ſuch excellent vſe vnto her, iudge ye.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the preaching of the word, is a iuſt practiſe in reſpect of it ſelfe. For why? Euery word of God is pure, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.5. It is as ſiluer tried in a furnace of earth, purified ſeauen times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6. It is good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. It is holy and iuſt and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. It is ſpirituall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. And it endureth for euer, 1. <hi>Pe.</hi> 1.25. Now it is a moſt iuſt thing that that which is pure, and ſpirituall, and holy, and iuſt, and good, &amp; endureth for euer, ſhould be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and made knowne to the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> If any ſhall obiect againſt the equitie of the practiſe of the word, becauſe it comes not to ſet peace, but a ſword where it comes with power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I anſwere, The fault is not in the word, if contentions ariſe vpon the preaching of it; but it is in the hearers, which haue not grace to make any better vſe of it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in the firſt of the <hi>Kings</hi> 18.18. I haue not troubled <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but thou and thy fathers houſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this point may be this; firſt, that Miniſters are not therefore to be cenſured for their true preaching of Gods word, or to be vniuſtly condemned for their paines in their miniſtery, as though they had done, or committed ſome great offence; for if any faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preach the word, what doth he but that which is iuſt and meete?</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſheweth how vniuſtly zealous Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are reproached for their hearing of Gods word; for their reading, conferring, meditating and the like. For
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:10122:67"/> what doe they in this but that which is iuſt and meete to be done?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſheweth how vniuſtly idle miniſters deale with the Church of God, in depriuing it of Gods word, through their wretched idleneſſe. Theſe are like vnto bad ſtewards, which keepe back the appointed food from their fellow ſeruants, and ſo ſtarue the family. But let ſuch remember that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.51. That God will cut them aſunder, and giue them their portions with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it condemneth the practiſe of the Papiſts and their adhaerents, which labour by all meanes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the powerfull preaching of Gods word, and in ſtead thereof bring in their Maſſes and their owne tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe deale vniuſtly with the word of God, and with Gods Church: theſe are they and ſuch like, which with-hold the truth in vnrighteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. And therfore woe will be vnto them vnleſſe they repent.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, this may comfort Gods Miniſters and Gods people: although they may be iudged hardly of in the world, the one for preaching the word, and the other for hearing and practiſing of it; yet let them reioyce in this, namely becauſe they doe nothing in this practiſe but which is iuſt and meete in the ſight of God. And if God approue, what need we feare if all the world beſides condemne our practiſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I thinke it iuſt.</hi> Whence note that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>the publiſhing of Gods word is a iuſt thing, not only in the ſight of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſight of good men. Peter</hi> himſelfe eſteemeth it a iuſt thing; and <hi>Wiſedome is iuſtified of her children, Luke</hi> 7.35. The feete of them which bring glad tidings, are beautifull in the eyes of the godly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. though
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10122:67"/> they be odious to the vngodly, though the Athenian phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers accounted <hi>Paul</hi> but a trifler or a babler, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.18. yet he was honoured by others.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> Gods people are enlightned to ſee how faithfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching brings glory to God, and how it brings good to the Church, and how iuſt a thing it is in it ſelfe. They can looke further into theſe myſteries then vnregenerate perſons can; and therefore they haue a better faculty to approue the things that are excellent, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But here it may be obiected, Do not many profeſſors diſapproue and ſpeake euill of many a faithful miniſtery, as well as the profaner ſort? And were not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles perſecuted by certaine deuout and honeſt women? <hi>Acts</hi> 13.50. Therefore it may ſeeme that the faithfull preaching of Gods word, is not ſo much as approued by the very Church it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I anſwere. I doubt not, but that many of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a time may neglect and lightly eſteeme a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miniſtery, being carried away with praeiudicate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which they haue of the perſon of the Miniſter; but certainly God will reueale this vnto them in time, and then they will repent their preiudice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there be tares in the corne-field of Gods Church, as well as good corne. Therein be hypocriticall profeſſors, as well as ſincere worſhippers: and it is the broode of hypocrites eſpecially which perſecute Gods Miniſters, hauing itching eares, and will not endure wholſome doctrine; it is not the beſt ſort of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
               <p>This puts a manifeſt difference betwixt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God and others. Gods children approue a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10122:68"/> powerfull Miniſtery, others for the moſt part doe not ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, let it ſerue to ſtirre vp all that thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be Gods children, to approue themſelues ſo by their approuing things excellent, and by their ſtanding for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Thirdly, let it be matter of comfort to Gods miniſters and people. Suppoſe that thy godly waies and courſes be diſtaſted by multitudes of men of corrupt mindes; yet this may be thy comfort, they are well approued of by them that are godly, and by ſuch as are truely iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I thinke.</hi> Obſerue here, the Apoſtle doth not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his iudgement or thoughts, but makes it knowne what he thinkes concerning religious practiſes, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preaching and writing of Gods word, and the like. <hi>I thinke it a iuſt thing.</hi> Whence we may learne this inſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the part and dutie of a true Chriſtian, not to diſſemble his religion, but he ought to make manifeſt by his profesſion, words, and practiſes, what he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this we haue many examples in Scripture. As firſt, the example of the religious Iewes which built the Temple at <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> who when their enemies came vnto them and asked their names, they made anſwere reſolutely, That they were the ſeruants of the God of heauen and earth, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 5.11. Secondly, the example of the three children, who when <hi>Nebucadnezar</hi> the king ſpake roughly, and threatningly vnto them, replied in theſe words: We are not carefull ô king, to anſwer thee in this matter, &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16. Thirdly, the example of <hi>Timothy,</hi> who made a good profeſſion before many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10122:68"/> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. but eſpecially of Chriſt himſelfe, who witneſſed a good confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may ſerue to condemne the practiſe of many time ſeruers, which carry their religion ſo cloſely, that no man can tell what to make of them, whether they be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, or Papiſts, or Anabaptiſts. But let ſuch remember, that as they haue beene aſhamed of Chriſt &amp; of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell before men; ſo will Chriſt be aſhamed of them at the laſt day, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this tabernacle,</hi> that is, in this body. Whence we are to obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>A Chriſtian is in this world as in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or Tent.</hi> Or thus, <hi>The body of a Chriſtian is like a Tent or Tabernacle.</hi> For the proofe I referre you to that in, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. We know that if this earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolued, &amp;c. Of this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, that is, of this body. And in the fourth verſe of the ſame Chapter, For we that are in this Tabernacle doe groane, &amp;c. that is, we that are in this body.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And the body is fitly compared to a Tent or Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: Firſt, becauſe as a Tent or Tabernacle, is not made of any ſtrong matter, hauing a few poles for the timber, and thinne cloathes for the walles. Euen ſo the bodies of Chriſtians are weake and frayle; their ſtrength is not the ſtrength of ſtones, or their fleſh of braſſe, <hi>Iob.</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as tents were for the vſe of ſouldiers, and are vnto this day; as it is ſaid of the Arke and <hi>Ioab,</hi> that they were in tents, that is, in warre, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.11. So while a Chriſtian is in the body, he is in a combating eſtate, or in a ſtate of warfare, warring eſpecially againſt his owne corruptions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as a Tent neuer ſtood long in one place, but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10122:69"/> it was taken downe and remoued from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as we reade of <hi>Iſrael</hi> coming out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they pitched their tents in one place, ſometimes in another, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. Euen ſo we muſt not thinke that this tabernacle of our bodies will alwaies ſtand; God will certainely take it downe, it ſhall not continue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerues for matter of reproofe vnto all ſuch as put away from them the euill day, which thinke that their ſtanding ſhall not be remoued. Alas, conſider with thy ſelfe, thou dwelleſt not in a walled City, or within ſtrong bulwarkes which cannot be pierced with gun-ſhot; but thou dwelleſt within paper walles, in a Tent which may be pierced with a very pinne. I meane thy very body and fleſh, is but a ſilly Tent. Therefore be not ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let this teach euery one of vs to be alwaies ready for death: we know not how ſoone God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue our tent, euen to day before to morrow; let the remainder therefore of our liues, be a ſerious meditation of death, and a preparation for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As long</hi> as I am in this Tabernacle, that is, as long as I liue. Whence obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the duty of a Miniſter to continue his miniſteriall paynes euen to the death.</hi> This was the practiſe of <hi>Paul</hi> in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.3. <hi>You are in our hearts to die and to liue together.</hi> And of <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon by his enemies, and ſlaine as he was preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.57. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Samuel;</hi> yea, of all the Prophets and Apoſtles: as they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued faithfull Miniſters, ſo they neuer reuolted from their calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeede the Church of God, ſhall alwaies haue neede of her Miniſters. Gods Miniſters are ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10122:69"/> and his people are ſheep: therefore as ſheep ſhal alwayes need a ſhepheard: ſo Gods church ſhall alwaies need a Leuite.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">1. Obiection.</note> But ſome may poſſibly obiect: Yea but ſuppoſe a Miniſter be ſickely and weake, and that preaching is an enemy to his health; is he bound to continue his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the impairing of his health? I anſwer, A good Miniſter muſt be content to ſpend, and to be ſpent for the people: he muſt with <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpend his ſtrength, though it ſeem to be in vaine, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.4. He muſt with the good ſhepheard lay downe his life for the ſheep, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.11. Where ſhould a ſouldier die but in the field? And where ſhould a good Miniſter die but in the Pulpet? Indeed it is true, a Miniſter muſt not ouer-charge himſelfe with preaching, but he muſt haue ſome reſpect to his health, that he may continue the longer to do good. But I ſhall not need to ſtand vpon this; for there be but few Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters which ſtrain themſelues beyond their ſtrength. We Miniſters neede not be tempted to ſpare our ſelues, we are too prone to that of our owne accord.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">2. Obiection.</note> Againe, it may be obiected: Yea but a Miniſter may poſſibly be reſtrained from preaching, by authority; how can he then continue his preaching or paines to death? I anſwer, If a Miniſter be reſtrained by lawfull authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then he muſt thinke God hath wrought by him, and accompliſhed already the maine worke whereunto he ſent him: He muſt think when he is vtterly depriued, as <hi>Paul</hi> thoght, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4: That he finiſhed his courſe, I mean for preaching. Howbeit I take it, that a depriued Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is not exempted from writing for the good of Gods Church. <hi>Paul</hi> writ diuers Epiſtles for the vſe of Gods Church when he was in priſon: and ſo did <hi>Ieremy</hi> cauſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:10122:70"/> a roule to be written, and to be read to the people by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruch,</hi> when he himſelfe was in priſon, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 36.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">3. Obiection.</note> Yea but ſuppoſe that a Miniſter cannot liue by his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, may he not in this caſe caſt it off, and take vpon him a more gainfull trade? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> A Miniſter, in caſe of want, may lawfully (as I take it) leaue this or that particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. For indeede it is a kinde of perſecution to muſſle the Oxe which treadeth out the corne: but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to caſt off his calling, in reſpect of want, I thinke it vnlawfull: yea, a Miniſter muſt preach ſtill, though he ſhould be conſtrained to labour with his hands, as <hi>Paul</hi> did.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this doctrine may ſerue, firſt for the iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of many Miniſters: firſt, of ſuch as will be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for a time; but afterwards caſt off the very name of Miniſters, ſome turning to be Doctors of Phyſicke, ſome turning to be Schoole-maiſters, and ſome turning idlers and the like. O my brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be. You receiued not your miniſteriall calling with condition to leaue it, and to caſt it off at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But you were married to the Miniſterie, to haue and to hold, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth to reprooue ſuch Miniſters as wil preach painfully and diligently vntil they get liuing; but when they are once inducted and ſetled in a rich Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, then caſt off preaching, as an impertinent thing: theſe vſe preaching, only as a ſtirrop whereby to mount into the ſaddle of preferment. O wretched hypocriſie! Doeth not this plainly bewray that thou neuer prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedſt of conſcience, but in meere policie? But let ſuch remember, that he that knoweth to do well, and doth it not, to him it is ſinne, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.17. Yea let him neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:10122:70"/> that in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. Neceſſitie is laid vpon me, and woe is vnto me if I preach not the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſhould teach the people, ſo to prouide for the certaine maintenance of the Miniſter, and to giue vnto him that kinde entertainment and reſpect, that he may be encouraged to abide with them, and to take paines amongſt them, euen vnto death. This care is much wanting in people at theſe days, wherin they labor to pull away what poſſibly they may from the Miniſter; vſing their tongues alſo to weary out a Miniſter, becauſe they deſire not his company till death, but rather to be rid of him, and that quickly. But let ſuch murderers (for ſo the holy Ghoſt termeth them) remember that God will ſend forth his ſouldiers, and deſtroy them and burn vp their Citie, as it is ſaid in <hi>Math.</hi> 22.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſtirre you vp.</hi> Marke; he doth not ſay, to inſtruct you onely, but to ſtirre you vp. Whence obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the duty oſ a Miniſter, not onely to informe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo by his doctrine to endeuour to worke vpon the affections.</hi> To ſtirre vp concerneth the affections eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. This was the practiſe of <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Corint.</hi> 5.11.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon the will and affections. Yea it was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of all the Prophets and Apoſtles, as appeareth by their writings. They endeuoured to ſpeake to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and not to the eare onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeed, though the minde were neuer ſo well informed; yet, if the will and affections be not in ſome meaſure wrought vpon for practiſe, all the labour in informing the minde, is but in vaine. Religion is more in the will and affections, then in any other facultie of the ſoule whatſoeuer. I confeſſe it is true, the mind muſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:10122:71"/> firſt be inſtructed before the wil and affections be ſtirred vp, or elſe we ſhall giue a heate without light, which is not ſo ſafe. But we muſt not ſo inſiſt vpon the firſt duty, as to neglect the ſecond. A miniſter muſt be both a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and a burning light.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This makes againſt them which condemne zealous preaching. For I demand; Doth not zealous preaching eſpecially ſtirre vp? Surely it doth. And if it do, then it is very needfull. Yea it is after the manner of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preaching, for they endeuoured to ſtirre vp, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in this Text.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerues to reproue many Miniſters which aime to ſpeake to the eare, but they ſpeake not to the heart; which ſo reſpect the iudgement that they neglect the affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſtion.</note> But ſome may demand, What muſt a Miniſter doe that he may by his doctrine ſtirre vp, or worke vpon the will and affections?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I anſwer: he that deſireth to worke effectually vpon the will and affections muſt obſerue theſe rules:</p>
               <p>1. He muſt not bring his owne idle inuentions, but the pure word of God. Gods word is the great meanes of perſwading.</p>
               <p>2. He muſt be a ſonne of Thunder, he muſt ſpeake, not drowſily, but with life and power.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he muſt endeuour to make it appeare, that he deſireth vnfainedly the good of his hearers; and that he preacheth not of enuy, but of good will.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he muſt practiſe himſelfe that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to perſwade others vnto. People at theſe dayes are perſwaded, more by the life of a Miniſter, then by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:10122:71"/>
               <p>Fiftly, he muſt pray vnto God for the people, that he by his Spirit would perſwade the people. He that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth or perſwadeth the heart to that which is good, hath his chaire in heauen.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, he muſt often put the people in minde of the ſame things. As the Apoſtle doth here, he ſtirreth vp them vnto whom he writeth, by putting them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. We will not inſiſt vpon this clauſe, <hi>By put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you in remembrance,</hi> any further, becauſe we haue deliuered the doctrine of it before in the twelfth verſe of this chapter.

               <p>Secondly, this may ſerue to teproue ſuch as immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately do ſeeke after wealth, being as vnſatiable in ſeeking riches, as if they eſteemed themſelues and their children to be immortall; or as though they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for an earthly eternity.

For firſt, it ſhould teach vs not to deferre our repentance, but whileſt it is called to day, we ought to turne from the power of Satan to God, and that with ſound humiliation. But thou wilt ſay, I can do this ſoone enough when I am old. But conſider with thy ſelfe, Art thou ſure to liue vntill thou beeſt old? haſt thou a leaſe of thy life? Or, ſuppoſe thou couldſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that thou ſhouldſt liue vntill thou be old, yet how knoweſt thou that God, at that time, will giue thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>

God will take them away ſoone enough, by one occaſion or by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be matter of comfort vnto all ſuch as beleeue; for now is their ſaluation nearer then when they beleeued.

               <p>The doctrine hence is this, namely, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſhortneſſe of life, ought to be an eſpeciall ſpurre, or motiue to prouoke all Chriſtians, as well people as Miniſters, to double diligence in well doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Salomon</hi> writ the booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> in his old age. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> writ diuers of his epiſtles when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Thus Chriſt himſelfe exerciſed his miniſterie, wrought miracles, and did all his great wonders in the three laſt yeares of his life. Why were theſe ſo diligent at the laſt, but becauſe they conſidered they were not long to continue? As Chriſt alſo himſelfe doth acknowledg, <hi>Iohn 9.4.</hi> I muſt worke the workes of him that hath ſent me while it is day; the night cometh wherein no man can worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And there is great reaſon that men ſhould beſtirre themſelues eſpecially towards their latter end, for they muſt either then worke or neuer: they muſt either then doe good, or elſe hereafter it will be too late, according to that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.35. Walke while ye haue light, leſt the darkeneſſe come vpon you.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerues to reproue them which purpoſe to liue idly, when they are growne old; not conſidering that approaching of death, ſhould be a motiue to greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in doing good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let this ſerue to ſtirre vs vp both Miniſters and people, to be more diligent in our places to glorify God. Let vs thinke we haue none of vs all to abide here long; and when we ſhall be gone, we ſhall not haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to returne to diſpatch any thing which we haue left vnperfected. Therefore, ſince with <hi>Peter</hi> we muſt ſhortly lay downe this Tabernacle, let vs ſtirre vp our
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10122:74"/> ſelues to more diligence in well doing. Thou which art a Miniſter, doſt thou thinke that thou ſhalt not liue long? Be the more diligent in preaching and writing. Thou which art an Officer, doſt thou thinke or know that thou ſhalt not long continue in thy office? Be the more carefull to doe good in it, that little time thou ſhalt continue. Thou which art a priuate Chriſtian, art thou perſwaded that death approcheth? Therefore worke out thy ſaluation with feare and trembling, glorifie God what poſſibly thou canſt, and whileſt thou haſt yet opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, doe as much good as thou canſt, eſpecially to the houſhold of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know.</hi> How did <hi>Peter</hi> know that he was not long to continue? Not by the courſe of nature, feeling himſelfe to decay, but by expreſſe ſpeech from Chriſts owne mouth, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.18. But when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands, and another ſhall gyrd thee: and in verſe 1. This ſpake he; ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorifie God.</p>
               <p>Now obſerue, here Chriſt told <hi>Peter</hi> before hand, that in his old age he ſhould ſuffer a violent death; and <hi>Peter</hi> gaue ſuch vndoubted credit to the words of Chriſt that he ſaith: I know that I ſhall ſhortly lay downe this Tabernacle, as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhewed to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know.</hi> The doctrine is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>euery man, both Miniſters and people, ought to be infallibly perſwaded of the truth and veritie of Gods word.</hi> If Chriſt ſaith it, we may and ought to ſay by Faith, We know it to be true. Thus it was with <hi>Martha, Iohn</hi> 11.24. I know he ſhall riſe againe at the laſt day. Now how did <hi>Martha</hi> know that her brother ſhould riſe againe, but by the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10122:74"/> word and Spirit of God? The like we ſee in the whole Church, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. We know that if this Tabernacle be diſſolued, &amp;c. Now how did the Church know this future glory, but by the word?</p>
               <p>The like we ſee in <hi>Peter</hi> elſewhere, as in the third chapter of this ſecond epiſtle, the third verſe: Knowing this firſt, that there ſhall come in the laſt daies ſcoffers. Now how did <hi>Peter</hi> know this, but by the word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Many other examples might be alledged, but theſe may ſuffice ſor the proofe of the point.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeede we haue great reaſon to be infallibly perſwaded of the truth and veritie of Gods word. Firſt, becauſe God is not as man, that he ſhould lie; he is truth it ſelfe he cannot lie. Therefore what he ſpeaketh, it is infallibly true.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the word hath beene proued to be an vndoubted truth from generation to generation; it was neuer found contrary, and therefore we haue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to call the truth of it into queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may ſerue to condemne Atheiſme, which is not nor will not be perſwaded of the truth of Gods word. But let all Atheiſts aſſure themſelues, that they which will not beleeue the word for the preſent, they ſhall find and feele the truth of it to their coſt in hell fire. For they which will not beleeue ſhall be damned, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After my deceaſe.</hi> Or, as it is in the originall, After my going out, meaning out of the tabernacle of his bodie; where from the periphraſis or deſcription of death, in that it is termed an exodus, or going out, or a deceaſe and departure, we may obſerue that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>A man when he dies, he doth but remoue from one place to another, his death
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10122:75"/> is onely a departure, or a changing of place.</hi> When <hi>Ioſua</hi> dieth, he is ſaid but to goe the way of all the earth, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 23.14. When the Saints die, they are ſaid but to come to a company of innumerable Angels, and to the generall aſſembly, and Church of the firſt borne which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heauen, and to God the iudge of all, and to the ſpirits of iuſt men made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22.23. And when Chriſt himſelfe dieth, he is ſaid but to goe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.22. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Symeon,</hi> whoſe death was but a peaceable departure, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.24. Lord now letteſt thou thy ſeruant depart in peace, &amp;c. Thus we ſee the proofe of this point, to wit, that when a man dieth, he doth but departe from one place to goe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> But hence ſome may ſay: Is mans death but a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? I pray you therefore tell me whither doth the ſoule of man goe, when it departeth out of the body?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Not to Purgatory, or Limbo. For all the Chriſtian world knowes, that theſe places are meerely imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, inuented by the Clergie of Rome, for the maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Popes kitchin, and haue no ſound ground from the word of God.</p>
               <p>But if we would know indeede, according to Gods word, whither foules departe or goe at the houre of death: we muſt take notice, that all ſoules of men they goe not to one place. For as for the ſoules of the elect, they vndoubtedly goe to heauen, as we ſee in the example of the penitent theefe, of whom Chriſt ſaid, This day thou ſhalt be with me in paradiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. And on the contrary, the ſoules of the reprobate, they go to hell, as we ſee in the example of the rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.23.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:10122:75"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> If any ſhall demand further, who conducteth the ſoules in their paſſage to heauen or to hell; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I anſwer: As for the ſoules of the elect, they are carried by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into the kingdome of heauen; as we ſee in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Lazarus, Luke</hi> 16.22.

               <p>Thus we ſee the point proued and amplified. </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of it, is briefly for matter of comfort to the children of God, both concerning their chriſtian friends deceaſed, they haue but changed their habitation; they are but gone from earth to heauen; they haue but made a bleſſed departure: And alſo concerning themſelues, whenſoeuer it ſhall be their lot to die, their ſoules ſhall onely depart, or goe out of a worſe place into a better. They ſhall be cut off from the earth indeede, but they ſhall be receiued &amp; find ſweet entertainment in heauen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may make for the ouerthrow of Atheiſts, in the point of the ſoules mortalitie, which they wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold. But conſider, here the ſoule is not ſaid to die, but to depart or to change place; which doth plainly imply that it is immortall and not mortall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may make for the terror of the wicked; they ſhall not die when they die, death will flie from them when they moſt deſire it. At death they ſhall only depart, they ſhall with <hi>Iudas</hi> goe to their owne place, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.25. But they ſhal haue a heauie departure, they ſhall go from their pleaſures to their tortures; they ſhall leaue the company of their friends, and come into the company
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:10122:76"/> of diuels; they ſhall depart from their delightfull houſe &amp; fields and gardens, &amp; ſhall be brought down to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt hell. O conſider this you that forget God, and repent, that you may preuent this wofull departure, and that your end may be peace.</p>

                  <hi>I will endeuour that after my deceaſe &amp;c.</hi> Whence wee are to note that, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods Miniſters ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to their power, to doe good to Gods Church for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as well as during their life time.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Peter</hi> here; he was not only carefull of the Church in his generation, but alſo he deſired to take ſuch a courſe as that the people of God might remember his doctrine after his deceaſe. The like care was in the Prophets and Apoſtles; they did not preach in their times and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations only, but alſo they did write for the good of Chriſtians in after-times, as God alſo enioyned them, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 30.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon</note> And indeede it makes much for Gods glory, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould doe as much good as poſſibly they can for the building vp of the body of his Sonne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Loue to the brethren ſhould ſtirre vs vp if we be Miniſters, to this godly care.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the good of our owne ſoules; for I ſuppoſe that if a Miniſters writings many hundred yeeres after his death doe conuert ſoules, he ſhall not loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of that after good, which is done by his works, but aſſuredly his works ſhall follow him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſhewes the neceſſity of writing as well as of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Preaching indeede is moſt profitable for the Church that now is; but for the ſucceeding Churches, writing is exceeding behouefull. And therefore many Miniſters are too much to blame this way: Firſt, ſuch
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10122:76"/> as are not ſo much as carefull for the preſent good of the Church, liuing idle and neglecting preaching; ſo farre are they from reſpecting the future good of ſucceeding ages. Secondly, ſuch Miniſters are likewiſe to blame, which howſoeuer during their life time they preach, yet they doe not what they might for ſucceeding times; they doe not write though they be able, for the good of the poſteritie. Theſe ſucceede the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the office: but not in Miniſteriall care and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cunning fables.</hi> By cunning or ſophiſticall fables we are to vnderſtand erronious doctrin, ſuch as had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the word of God, but was hatched only in the braine of man. And erronious doctrine is fitly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this place and in many places of <hi>Paules</hi> Epiſtles, to fables. Firſt, becauſe as fables haue no truth in them, but are meerely forged and framed: ſo erronious doctrine hath no ſoundneſſe, or ſoliditie in it, but is falſe and lying; according to that in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 2. They ſpeake lies through hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe as fables are delightfull to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified eare; ſo erronious doctrine is pleaſing and plauſible to vnregenerate and prophane perſons, yea, more plauſible then the truth. As it is ſaid, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. They ſhall turne away their eares from the truth, and ſhall be giuen vnto fables.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe as fables, although they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light for the preſent, yet they do not profit the hearers: euen ſo erronious doctrin, though it be neuer ſo glorious in ſhew, and neuer ſo pleaſing, yet it profiteth not the hearers, but leaues them in their ſinnes and vnregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; according to that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. Receiued ye the ſpirit,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10122:77"/> by the works of the Law? that is, by the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> doctrine of the Law. Implying that the <hi>Galatians</hi> neuer receiued any ſpirituall good by falſe and erronious doctrin, which was obtruded vpon them by the falſe Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Againe, erronious doctrine is compared to cunning fables, or ſophiſticall deuices: Becauſe as ſophiſters vſe much cunning and quercks, and fallacies to deceiue in arguing and diſputing; euen ſo erronious teachers are deceitfull workers, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. Yea, they lie in waite to deceiue with cunning crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as we reade, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cunning fables we haue not followed.</hi> Hence Miniſters muſt learne, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>In their teaching and preaching to auoide er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and all euill deceit, to deliuer ſound doctrine, and that with pure pretence.</hi> This was the practiſe of <hi>Peter</hi> here, and of the reſt of the Apoſtles and Prophets, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both by their writings and by their proteſtations. I ſay the truth (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) and lie not, my conſcience bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. and, We are not as many, which corrupt the word; but as of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, but as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpeake we in Chriſt, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. Yea it is manifeſt that theſe men dealt ſincerely with the word of God, in that they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale their owne infirmities, but acknowledged them in their writings; as <hi>Matthew,</hi> that he was a publicane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt called him, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.9. And <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had beene a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, and iniurious, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. Whereas if they had beene deceitfull, they would haue kept cloſe their owne ſinnes. Yea, this is that which the holy Ghoſt requireth of all Miniſters, to wit, To be ſound and ſincere in the diſpenſing of Gods will. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. But refuſe prophane and old wiues tales, &amp;c. 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10122:77"/> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. But ſpeake thou the things which become ſound doctrine. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. And it is required of a ſteward, that a man be found faithfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And the truth is, that vnleſſe Miniſters deale truly and ſincerely in the preaching of Gods word, they loſe their reward. For if any mans worke burne, he ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer loſſe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. Yea, they ſhall be liable to a curſe, for adding to, or detracting from the perfect will of God, <hi>Reu.</hi> 22.18.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this point may ſerue to reproue erronious and deceitfull Teachers, which ſophiſticate the word of God, by the mingling of their owne crotches and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile diſtinctions to deceiue. Whether they doe this for their credit, that they might be eſteemed witty men; or for their gaine, that they might pleaſe humorous men, that ſo they might the more deeply inſinuate themſelues into their purſes: certaine it is, they runne counter to the holie Apoſtles and Prophets; they neuer learned their deceit of them: And they are ſucceſſors not of the Apoſtles, but rather of the falſe prophets, whoſe ſteps they follow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may iuſtly reproue many people and hearers, which turne away their eares from the truth, and are giuen vnto fables; as the Apoſtle ſpeakes 2. <hi>Timothie</hi> 4.4. How many be there in the world which had rather heare a witty ſpeech out of ſome profane writer, then a ſound ſentence out of Gods word? And how many be there that are more affected to the idle inuentions of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, or to the vaine ſpeculations of Anabaptiſts, or to queſtions about ceremonies, and the gouernement of the Church, then in anie ſort to the ſolide truth? Oh, let ſuch remember here, that if Miniſters ought not to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10122:78"/> preach fables, then they ſhould not be giuen to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For we haue not followed.</hi> From the beginning of this ſixteenth verſe vnto the end of the Chapter, the Apoſtle alledgeth many reaſons, why the Church is to heare him, and to hearken vnto him. As firſt, becauſe he dealt ſincerely. Secondly, becauſe he was an eye-witnes vnto that which he deliuered. Both theſe arguments are layd downe in this ſixteenth verſe. Thirdly, becauſe he was an eare-witneſſe, and this argument is layd downe in the ſeuenteene and eighteene verſes. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in his teaching he did not ſwarue from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prophets. And this argument is laid downe in 19.20. and 21. verſes.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="verse">
               <p>
                  <hi>For we haue not followed cunning fables.</hi> In that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth here intimate, that the Church ought to reſpect his doctrine and writings, and to receiue the ſame, becauſe he dealt ſincerely with the word of God: therefore hence we are to obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It ought to be a great motiue to Gods people, to hearken to their Ministers, when they are conuinced in their conſciences, that they deale ſincerely betweene God and them.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. Receiue vs: We haue wronged no man, we haue corrupted no man, &amp;c. ſhewing this as a reaſon why the Corinthians ought to receiue him, becauſe he had corrupted no man. And what was it that mooued the Church to giue ſuch credit to the writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, but becauſe they were perſwaded in their conſciences by the Spirit of God, that theſe men did deale truly and ſincerely in the matters of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This makes againſt ſuch, that the more they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced, that Miniſters deale ſincerely, the more they will flee from their Miniſtery, and be leſſe ruled by them.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10122:78"/> Theſe are they that hate the light, and will not come to the light, leſt their workes ſhould be reproued.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Secondly, it ſhould teach vs Miniſters to preach ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of faith, and to deale faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the matters of God, that our teaching may be of the more authoritie in the hearts of Gods people, and may doe the more good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Making knowne vnto you.</hi> Whence we may obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Euery man and woman, yea euen the very elect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are naturally, without the knowledge of the Goſpel.</hi> They know it not vntill it be made knowne vnto them: a man may poſſibly haue the law of God by nature writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart; but as for the knowledge of the Goſpel, it is farre from him. The very heathen had ſome glimpſe of the law, they were able by the light of nature to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that vice ſhould be ſhunned, and vertue followed: but as for the Goſpell, they were vtterly ignorant of it, ſuppoſing onely to come to heauen, by the ladder of their owne vertuous actions. Yea, this ſaluation by Chriſt, it is ſuch a myſterie, as that it ſurmounted the capacitie both of Angels and men, once to dreame of it, vntill it was reuealed. For what creature could once haue imagined, that God would euer haue giuen his owne Sonne to be made a man, and to die an accurſed death vpon the tree, and that for his very enemies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it had bene reuealed? And for this cauſe the goſpel is termed a myſterie diuers times in the Word, as in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 3.4. and <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.26. and in many other places; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed it was hid from the world, and ſurpaſſed the conceit of euerie creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But here ſome may obiect; Did not <hi>Balaam</hi> know, being a heathen man, that a ſtarre ſhould come out of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10122:79"/> 
                  <hi>Iacob, Numb.</hi> 23.17. Had he not ſome glimpſe in this, of ſaluation by Chriſt? I anſwer, Either <hi>Balaam</hi> in this his prophecie knew not what he ſaid, like vnto the High-prieſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.50.51. Or if otherwiſe, then vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was reuealed vnto him; it came not of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The conſideration of our want of knowledge of the Goſpell naturally, ſhould teach vs to be more ſtudious to ſearch into this myſterie that we may know it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the examples of the holie Angels, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. who being ignorant of the myſterie, deſire the more to prie into it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhould teach vs the more to admire the Goſpell, conſidering what a deepe myſterie it is. No doubt, but if the Goſpell were now to be firſt reuealed vnto vs, we would thinke it the moſt admirable thing in the world, for God to be made man, and for God to ſhed his owne bloud vpon a Croſſe, and that for rebels. Shall we admire theſe things onely for a time? are they not as worthy to be admired for euer, as for a ſeaſon? Shall we make the Goſpell onely a nine daies wonder? God forbid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Making knowne vnto you.</hi> Whence note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The Apoſtles are the eſpeciall instruments of manifeſting or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king knowne the myſterie of the Goſpell. Peter</hi> ſpeakes here in the perſon of the reſt; <hi>We made knowne vnto you, &amp;c.</hi> We deny not but the Goſpel was preached by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; for elſe, what had become of our fore-fathers, if Chriſt had not bene reuealed vnto them at all? Yea, Chriſt was preached, euen by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the ſacrifices for ſinne, and the like. But neuer was the Goſpell ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly taught, as by the Apoſtles: the aime of whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie was eſpecially to preach Chriſt. The Prophets
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10122:79"/> preached Chriſt afarre off, but the Apoſtles preached him at hand, yea already exhibited; <hi>Moſes</hi> preached Chriſt in darke ſhadowes, but the Apoſtles preached him manifeſtly, without any ſhadow. And hereupon the Apoſtles are termed Miniſters of the new Teſtament, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. becauſe indeed the diſpenſation of the Goſpell was eſpecially committed vnto them. Hereupon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Apoſtles terme the Goſpell, their Goſpell, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.3. to ſhew that it was committed vnto them after an eſpeciall manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But ſome poſſibly may obiect, that the Apoſtles were the moſt vnfit perſons of many other, to be intruſted with the great and deepe myſterie of the Goſpell; for they were vnlearned men, ſome of them being ſilly Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhermen and the like. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> I anſwer in the Apoſtles words; They had this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the power might be of God, and not of them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> But let it teach vs, that if euer we deſire to attaine the myſterie of knowledge which is in the Goſpell, we muſt be ſtudious in the reading, and hearing, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of the new Teſtament, which containes the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles: This is the field wherein this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is eſpecially to be found.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it teach vs to be thankefull, in that we enioy theſe writings; for in them is contained eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the myſterie of the Goſpell, and the meanes of reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chriſt vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The power and ccming.</hi> Vnder theſe two words Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Coming, by a Synechdoche is vnderſtood the ſumme of the whole Goſpell, part being put for the whole. And by the power of Chriſt is ſet forth his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10122:80"/> nature, whereby he did many miracles; as by his coming we are to vnderſtand his incarnation, or firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We made knowne vnto you the Power and Coming.</hi> The Apoſtle did not exerciſe himſelfe in vnneceſſarie queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the Law, or in impertinent froathy diſcourſes to fill vp the time; but he ſpent both his Sermons and writings, in ſpeaking and declaring of Chriſt, which is a good patterne for vs Miniſters: <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>We muſt learne aboue all other doctrine to preach Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> I doe not deny but that the morall law is alſo to be taught. For the Goſpell doth not abrogate the moralitie of the law, but doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. Yea, the preaching of the law is an excellent preparatiue to the Goſpell, as we ſee by the miniſterie of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt, Matth.</hi> 3.3. There muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be a caſting downe by the Law, before there be a raiſing vp by the Goſpel: there muſt be a wounding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be an healing: there muſt be a ſenſe of miſerie before there be an applying of comfort: the law muſt be as the needle to make way: the Goſpell muſt be as the ſilke threed to follow it. Thus there is a time both for the Law and the Goſpell. But howſoeuer Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with the Law, yet they muſt go on eſpecially with the Goſpell. This was the holy practiſe of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt;</hi> howſoeuer he began with the doctrine of repentance, and with terrour, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.8.10. yet he concluded with comfort, Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.29. This was the practiſe of <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8.35. he preached Ieſus to the Eunuch. This was the practiſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> he preached Chriſt in the Synagogues, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeed Chriſt is the foundation of all ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10122:80"/> No other foundation can any man lay (ſaith the Apoſtle) then that which is laid, Ieſus Chriſt, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 3.11. Therfore they which would preach groundedly, muſt preach Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the doctrine of Chriſt, it is of all other doctrine, the moſt excellent. <hi>Paul</hi> determined to know nothing but Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 2.2. Would a Miniſter therefore excell to the edification of the Church? Let him preach Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the doctrine concerning Chriſt, it is the moſt ſucceſſeful of any other doctrine; the Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted more by the doctrine of the Goſpell in twenty or thirtie yeares, then <hi>Moſes</hi> conuerted in many hundred yeares by the preaching of the Law. Doth a Miniſter therfore deſire to conuert ſoules? let him preach Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This makes iuſtly for the reproofe of ſuch Miniſters which preach altogether the rigour of the Law, keeping Gods Church ſtill vnder the heauy yoake of the Law, which neither we nor our Fathers were able to beare; and in the meane time conceale the doctrine of the Goſpel, which is much more ſucceſſefull. Let ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters know, that they ſhut vp the kingdome of heauen againſt men. They are cruell Surgeons, they make the wound, but they apply no plaiſter: how can they thinke euer to procure the health of Gods people?</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach Gods Church, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie congregation, to labour to be prepared to receiue the doctrine of the Goſpell: They muſt be humbled, that they may be raiſed; they muſt be caſt downe vnder the burden of ſinne, that they may be lifted vp by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Chriſt. The very reaſon why many Miniſters ſo beate vpon the Law, is, becauſe people are not yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10122:81"/> to receiue the glad tidings of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The power.</hi> By power here we are not to vnderſtand the authoritie of Chriſt (the Originall will not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly beare that ſence,) but rather his omnipotencie, whereby he is able to do great things. And the point hence is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt is ſtrong and mightie, able to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he will in heauen and in earth.</hi> Hence it is, that he is termed a Prophet, mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.19. Hence it is that he is termed the Mighty God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.6. Hence it is that he is called the Strong Redeemer, <hi>Iere.</hi> 50.34. Yea, let all his miracles teſtifie of his power; his turning water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wine, his feeding of many thouſands with ſmall prouiſion, his healing of all manner of plagues with his word, his caſting out diuels, his walking vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his ſtilling of the windes and ſeas, his raiſing of the dead, his faſting forty dayes and forty nights, with many more which are extant in the writings of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſuch was, and is the power of Ieſus, that he did not onely worke miracles in his owne perſon, but alſo he gaue power vnto others; namely, to the Apoſtles to work miracles in his name. For when he ſent them forth, he ſaid vnto them; Heale the ſicke, cleanſe the leapers, raiſe the dead, caſt out diuels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.8. Yea the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles profeſſed that they wrought miracles by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power, but by the power of Ieſus: His name (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) through faith in his name, hath made this man ſtrong, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.16. and, I command thee (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) in the name of Ieſus Chriſt to come out of her, ſpeaking to the ſpirit of diuination, which poſſeſſed a certaine maid, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16. Now how great muſt needes his power be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10122:81"/> which deriueth a power vnto others euen to worke very myracles?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Now if any ſhall obiect againſt the power of Chriſt, that Antichriſt hath and doth exceedingly preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in all ages, as it is ſaid of <hi>Antiochus, Dan.</hi> 11.36. that he did according to his will, and exalted, and magnified himſelfe aboue euery God: and of the Pope, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. that he oppoſeth and exalteth himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all that is called God. I anſwere: Although Chriſt may ſuffer Antichriſt for a time, yet he will cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tainly conſume him at the time appointed, with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his mouth, and will deſtroy him with the brightnes of his comming. 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may ſerue to diſcouer the falſhood of that ſpeech of the high Prieſts and of the Scribes, <hi>He ſaued o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, himſelfe he cannot ſaue, Marke</hi> 15.31. Chriſt had ſufficient power to haue reſcued himſelfe out of the hands of his enemies, but he would not: it was not the ſtrength of nayles, but the power of loue to the Church which faſtened Chriſt to the croſſe; had it not beene for our redemption, no humane power could poſſibly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their haue ſeiſed vpon, or retained Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may make for the terror of all Chriſts enemies. Chriſt is able to the vtmoſt to requite them for all their ſpite, both againſt himſelfe, and againſt his Church. He hath power in his hand; our redeemer is ſtrong, the Lord of Hoſts is his name, he ſhall throughly pleade their cauſe, and diſquiet the inhabitants of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.34. Yea he ſhall drinke of the brooke in the way, that is, ſhall be diligent in purſuing of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, therefore he ſhall lift vp the head, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this may miniſter comfort to the Church in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10122:82"/> times of daunger. Behold our redeemer in whom we truſt, he is able to deliuer vs out of all danger; for he is powerfull: wherefore let vs neuer be vtterly deiected, or deſpaire of helpe, but let vs looke vp to the omnipotency of Chriſt in all diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And comming.</hi> This is meant of the firſt comming of Chriſt, to wit, his comming in the fleſh, as the phraſe comming is alſo taken, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> Ieſus Chriſt came into the world, that is, was incarnate, or came in the fleſh. Now concerning Chriſts comming in the fleſh, diuers things are very remarkeable and eminent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he came of his owne accord, and not by conſtraint; he tooke our nature vpon him, it was not put vpon him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. It was no forced marriage but a ſought match.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he came in two reſpects different from all others; for he came by an extraordinary conception, to wit, being conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. and by an extraordinary birth, being borne of a pure virgin, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 7.14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that he came in great humilitie and debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the firſt place that he came into was a ſtable, as being borne in it; and the firſt cradle that he was laide in was a manger or a cratch, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.7.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that he came into great trouble and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for no ſooner was he borne, but all <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was in an vproare, and <hi>Herod</hi> ſought his life, <hi>Matthew</hi> 2.3.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this comming of Chriſt, and this manner of his comming, teach vs to admire the myſterie of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, wherein two natures were married together, to wit, his diuinitie and his humanitie, in the vnitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10122:82"/> without confounding either nature; ſo that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill very God and very man, yet but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it teach vs to admire Chriſts loue, in that he was content to come from heauen, from the Throne of his glory, thus for to be abaſed for vs. We may admire this, but we can neuer be ſufficiently thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let it teach vs to be ready to vndergoe any debaſement or ſuffering for Chriſt, conſidering what he hath vndergone for vs. If we come to loſſe and diſgrace, yea, to death it ſelfe for Chriſt; we muſt remember what he endured firſt for vs, and that ſhould make vs content and patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of his Maieſtie.</hi> By Maieſtie we are to vnderſtand here the appearing of Chriſts diuinitie, which did now and then ſhine forth, eſpecially by glimpſes in his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, actions, countenance, and transfiguration and the like. The point hence to be noted is this, to wit, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>There was Maieſtie in Chriſt, euen whilſt he liued vpon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was ſuch maieſtie in his words, as that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors did not onely admire the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.22. but alſo were enforced to acknowledge that neuer man ſpake like him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.46.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there was ſuch maieſtie in his workes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his myracles, as that it did amaze and aſtoniſh the ſpectators, according to that in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.56. <hi>And the parents were aſtoniſhed.</hi> It is meant of <hi>Iairus</hi> and his wife, that they were amazed when they ſaw their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rayſed from death to life.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:10122:83"/>
               <p>Thirdly, there was ſuch Maieſtie in his geſture and countenance, as that when he ſpake vnto the multitude which came with ſwords and ſtaues to take him, and ſaid vnto them, Whom ſeeke ye, I am he, they fell backward, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in his transfiguration there was that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie in his countenance, as that his face did ſhine as the Sunne, <hi>Math</hi> 17.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſtion.</note> If any ſhall demand whence this Maieſtie in Chriſt came: <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I anſwere; It flowed from the diuine nature which was in him: For euen as the ſoule within is the cauſe of beauty and grace in the countenance in men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the diuine nature was the cauſe of Maieſtie in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this teach vs to admire Chriſt, for if he was maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall in his humbled eſtate, how great is his Maieſty now in his exalted eſtate? Yea, let it teach vs to long for the appearing of Chriſt, and to deſire to be with Chriſt, that we may behold his glory which the Father hath giuen him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.24. And ſecondly, let it arme vs againſt the ſcandall of the croſſe: For what though Chriſt, for our wretched ſinnes was humbled, or rather humbled himſelfe to the baſe death of the croſſe; yet there was that Maieſtie in him, which was more of value to credit him, then there was indignitie in the croſſe to debaſe him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We were eye-witneſſes.</hi> Or as it is in the originall, We were made beholders of his Maieſtie. Hence obſerue that as there was Maieſtie in Chriſt; <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo it was, in ſome meaſure viſible;</hi> the beames of Chriſts ſplendor were not alwaies obſcured by the veile of his fleſh, but they did ſometime ſhine forth and appeare. For the proofe of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10122:83"/> this point, I referre you to that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.14: And the word was made fleſh and dwelt amongſt vs, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his glory; the glory, as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. And that in 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.2: The life was manifeſted, and we haue ſeene it. And vnto theſe may be added that in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> But vnto whom was Chriſts Maieſtie thus manifeſt or viſible? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Surely not to all, for, He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.10. Yea, ſome were ſo blinde, as that they were ready to ſay, What is thy beloued more then another beloued? <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. And <hi>Herod</hi> when he ſaw Chriſt, he deſpiſed him or ſet him at nought, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.11. Yea, the Princes of this world knew him not, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. But the Maieſtie of Chriſt it was eſpecially mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto ſuch as were effectually inlightened, according to that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.14. I am the good ſhepheard, and know my ſheepe, and am knowne of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Note.</note> I doe not deny, but that this Maieſtie of Chriſt was viſible alſo to the diuels: <hi>I know thee who thou art. Mark.</hi> 1.24. and alſo vnto wicked men, ſo farre as to amaze them with a ſuddaine glimpſe, as it is ſaid of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane multitude, <hi>Marke</hi> 1.26. That they were all ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, in ſo much that they queſtioned among themſelues ſaying; What thing is this, what new doctrine is this? for with authoritie commandeth he euen the vncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and they doe obey him. But it was effectually viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to none but to Gods elect.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this point may be to conuince the world of palpable blindneſſe, in that they could not behold the Sunne when it ſhined. Chriſt was the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes

                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:10122:85"/> and his glory was viſible, and how many were there notwithſtanding, that knew not his preſence?</p>
               <p>Secondly, it muſt ſerue to confirme our Faith, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſts diuine nature: that truth which we beleeue concerning the godhead of the Lord Ieſus, it was viſible and apparent in the times wherein he liued, yea it was viſible in ſome meaſure to his very enemies, and much more to the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it muſt teach vs to deſire that our eyes may be annointed with eie-ſalue, that we may ſtill behold the Maieſtie of Chriſt in his word, &amp; in his workes. The Maieſty of Chriſt is ſtill viſible, eſpecially to the eye of Faith; as <hi>Peter</hi> and they that were with him in the mount beheld Chriſts glory with corporall eyes: ſo euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer may at theſe daies ſee Ieſus crowned with glorie and honour by the eye of Faith, <hi>Heb</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this argues that the Maieſtie of Chriſt is much more viſible now, eſpecially in heauen: For if the Sunne ſhine bright at ſome times in a cloudy day, how much more when theſe cloudes are deſpelled?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eye-witneſſes.</hi> Whence we may note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had thorough knowledge of the truth of thoſe things which they did write and preach.</hi> They were eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and eare-witneſſes. This is that which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle and firſt Chapter, and third verſe: That which we haue ſeene and heard, declare we vnto you. And in the firſt verſe of the ſame Chapter: That which was from the beginning, which we haue heard, which we haue ſeene with our eyes, which we haue looked vpon, and our hands haue handled of the word of life, declare we vnto you. Hence it is that <hi>Luke</hi> tearmeth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles eye-witneſſes alſo in his firſt Chapter and ſecond verſe.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:10122:85"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> If any ſhall obiect, that to be an eye-witneſſe, or an eare-witneſſe, is not ſufficient to proue the certainty of a thing becauſe the ſenſes may be deluded. <hi>Saul</hi> thought he ſaw <hi>Samuel</hi> riſen from the dead, and that hee heard him ſpeaking to him, when he was meerely delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> Truth it is, that the ſenſes indeede may be deluded, but it was not ſo with the Apoſtles; for they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee with their eyes, and heare with their eares, but they had withall the teſtimony of Gods ſpirit, to aſſure them that their ſenſes were not deceiued: and they had the gift of Faith, whereby they had power to ſee more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into things, then that they could be deceiued.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this therefore teach vs to be aſſured of the truth of the Goſpell; it is deliuered, not by heare-ſay, but by them which were both eye-witneſſes, and eare-witneſſes of the ſame.

Three points are here to be obſerued. Firſt, the honor that was done to Chriſt; He receiued honor. Secondly, the meanes of that honour, it was by a voice from heauen. Thirdly, the witneſſes of it; And this voice which came from heauen we heard, that is, I <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>He receiued from God the Father.</hi> Doth not this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the glory of Chriſt, being very God, in that it is ſaid, that he receiued honour and glory from God the Father? For what neceſſitie had he to receiue honor and glory from another, which was very God himſelfe? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> The truth is, Chriſt, as God, receiued nothing from God the Father, but his ſubſiſtence or perſonalitie; but <hi>as he was man, ſo he receiued all things from the Father.</hi> And this he confeſſed himſelfe in diuers places as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. All things are deliuered to me of my Father; and in <hi>Math.</hi> 28.18. All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth: As the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo he hath giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.36.</p>
               <p>Yea, whatſoeuer Chriſt had, he had it from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he was man: He had his humane nature from him; A bodie haſt thou made me, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.5. He had his preſeruation from him: I was caſt vpon thee from the wombe, thou haſt bene my God from my mothers bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.10.

This was Chriſts portion in his humbled eſtate, rather then to command. The time was when Chriſt thought it no robberie, to be equall with God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. but now he muſt be inferiour, in reſpect of ſuffering death, to the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9.

                  <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi> Chriſt did greatly honour the Father, and the Father
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10122:87"/> gaue both honour and glory vnto Chriſt, as appeareth in this Text. The like may be ſaid of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles: They ſought not themſelues, but Gods glorie, and the Lord hath made them famous to the end of the world. The like may be ſaid of the good Kings of Iuda; they ſought Gods glorie, and God hath made them glorious by their hiſtories in the Bible. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob;</hi> and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable other Saints: they glorified God, and God hath made their memoriall bleſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> Now what is the reaſon that God will giue honour and glory vnto ſuch as ſeeke to glorifie him?

               <p>Secondly, let vs learne here what is the direct way to honour and reputation, and that is, to ſet our ſelues ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to ſeeke Gods glorie. Let vs honour God, and let him alone to honour vs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let vs hence be moued to be thankefull to God; firſt, for that he gaue ſuch honour and glorie to Chriſt our head; and ſecondly, for that he offereth alſo to honour vs the members, if according to the example of our head, we ſhall ſincerely affect his glorie.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let this teach vs, not to feare the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the wicked, or their ſlanders. God is able to put more honour vpon vs, if we ſeeke his glorie, then all the world is able to put diſgrace.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:10122:87"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Honour and glorie.</hi> This is meant of that honour and glorie, which Chriſt receiued at his transfiguration, as appeareth by the words immediatly following in the Text. He receiued from God the Father, honour and glorie, when the voice came from the excellent glorie.</p>
               <p>Now if any ſhal demand, what honor or glory Chriſt receiued at his transfiguration: I anſwer, He receiued great honour at that time; firſt, becauſe God the father ſpake by an audible voice from heauen, and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to be his beloued Sonne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Church was commanded to heare him, <hi>Marke</hi> 9.7. Thirdly, becauſe God ſent two men, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> from the dead, and that in their glorie, to ſpeake with him of his deceaſſe, which he ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh at <hi>Hieruſalem, Luke</hi> 9.31. All theſe things were matter of great honour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt receiued glorie, as well as honour, at his transfiguration. For firſt the faſhion of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was changed, <hi>Lu.</hi> 9.29. Yea his face did ſhine as the Sunne, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.2. which was matter of great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Againe, his raiment was white and gliſtering, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.29. White as the ſnow, ſo as no Fuller could white them, <hi>Marke</hi> 9.3. Yea white as the light, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.2. Thirdly, a bright cloud ouerſhadowed Chriſt and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> whileſt they talked together, as a rich Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.5. which did adde to the glory. And laſtly, all this was but to ſhadow out that admirable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wherein Chriſt ſhall appeare when he ſhall come in his kingdome at the laſt day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.28. Thus we ſee the truth of the Apoſtles doctrine, to wit, That Chriſt receiued both honor and glory, when ſuch a voice came from the excellent glorie, that is, at his transfiguration
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10122:88"/> vpon the mount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such a voice.</hi> If any ſhall demand what kind of voice it was; I anſwer, for the clearing of the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, firſt, that it was an heauenly voice: it came not out of the earth, but out of the cloude, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was a diuine voice; for it came not from anie creature, but from the excellent glorie, as in this Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Came to him.</hi> Why is this voyce ſaid to come to Chriſt, conſidering that it might ſeeme rather to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Apoſtles, heare him? &amp;c. It is ſaid to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Chriſt, not becauſe he alone heard it; for <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> heard the voice when it came from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as being with him in the holy mount: but rather, becauſe this voice did principally concerne Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as namely to teſtifie, that he was the Sonne of God, and that he was beloued of God, and that in him God was well pleaſed; yea it was ſent eſpecially to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt, and to comfort him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When ſuch a voice came.</hi> Whence obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath his time and ſeaſon to put honour vpon his children, though for a time he ſuffer them to be debaſed and ſcorned;</hi> We ſee it in this example. Chriſt was firſt many wayes debaſed, both by his incarnation, and by many perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the voice came from heauen at his transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, then he receiued honor. Thus it was alſo with <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> he was firſt ſold by his brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.28. then accuſed falſly by his Miſtriſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.17. then caſt into priſon by his Maiſter, <hi>Ge.</hi> 39.20. and there kept till the iron entred into his ſoule, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.18. But afterwards in due ſeaſon, he was highly exalted, and made the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man in the kingdome: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.20. But this was in the time when his word came, that is, at Gods time
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10122:88"/> appointed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And God doth giue to his children honour in due time; firſt, for the fulfilling of his promiſe; for he hath promiſed, that though they be for a time amongſt the pors, yet they ſhall be as the Wings of a Doue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. and Gods promiſe cannot faile.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Lord is carefull, that his children ſhould not put forth their hands to wickedneſſe, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 125.3. and therefore will not ſuffer the rod of the wicked to reſt vpon the backe of the righteous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord will not haue the ſpirits of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to faile before him, and therefore he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for euer, <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may be a terrour to the wicked, which labour to diſhonour the godly. Let them know, God hath a time to honour his children, maugre the malice of Satan, and all his inſtruments.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe 2.</note> Secondly, let all Gods children be of good comfort, though they ſuffer reproach for a time, God hath a time wherein to giue them honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such a voice.</hi> Whence note further, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Rather then Gods children ſhall want honour, God will giue them honour by extraordinary meanes.</hi> This is manifeſt, not onely out of the Text, wherein we ſee God ſent an extraordinarie voice to honour Chriſt, but alſo out of <hi>Luke</hi> 19.40: If theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would crie. Wherein is meant, that if people and children had not cried <hi>Hoſanna</hi> in honour of Chriſt, the very ſtones ſhould haue cried it, rather then Chriſt ſhould haue loſt his honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Yea but ſome may poſſibly ſay, We are not at theſe dayes to expect extraordinarie workes.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:10122:89"/>
               <p>We are not indeed to expect miraculous workes, but where ordinarie meanes faile, we may ſafely expect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie. Hath not God dealt extraordinarily in mercy with this Land, in deliuering of it from the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Inuaſion, in the yeare one thouſand fiue hundred eightie and eight; and from the Papiſts Gunpowder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot afterwards? Yes verily.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this therefore teach vs, neuer to caſt away our confidence; God is able to worke by meanes or without meanes: yea, where ordinarie meanes faileth, he is able to raiſe vp extraordinarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the excellent glorie.</hi> Whence obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>God dwelleth in the midſt of excellent glorie, yea of ſuch glorie as becometh his greatneſſe.</hi> All this the words in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall do imply; and for further proofe I referre you to that in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. where it is ſaid, that God dwelleth in that light which no man can approach vnto: where by light we are to vnderſtand glory, as by glorie we are to vnderſtand light, in 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 15.41. One ſtarre differeth from another in glory, that is, in degrees of light.</p>
               <p>But what glory is it which is anſwerable to Gods greatneſſe wherein he dwelleth? It is not meant ſingly of the glory of the third heauen. For no created glorie can poſſibly be anſwerable to an vncreated maieſty: but it is meant of that glory which is in God himſelfe, and which is eſſentiall vnto him, as appeareth by that in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> 33.18. where <hi>Moſes</hi> requeſteth to ſee Gods glorie, which is not meant of any circumiacent or aduentitious glorie which is without God, but of that glorie which is in God himſelfe, as appeareth by the anſwer; Thou canſt not ſee my face, <hi>Exodus</hi> 33.20. terming that in the twentieth verſe, Gods face, which <hi>Moſes</hi> termed in the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10122:89"/> eighteenth verſe, Gods glory, expounding the former by the later.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The conſideration hereof ſhould teach vs to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence God in our hearts, ſeeing he dwelleth in ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable glorie. Whoſe glorie ſhould we admire, but his glorie? whoſe greatneſſe, but his greatneſſe?</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it moue vs to deſire faith and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that with open face as in a cleare glaſſe we may behold the glorie of the Lord, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Yea, let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the Lord may ariſe vpon vs, and his glory may be ſeene vpon vs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 60.3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may teach vs to deſire to be with God in heauen; for when we are diſſolued, we ſhall ſee Gods face and his glorie, as the Angells are ſaid to doe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is my Sonne.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt is the Sonne of God by a twofold generation.</hi> Firſt, by his eternal generation, as he is the ſecond perſon in the bleſſed Trinitie, which generation who is able to declare? as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.8. Secondly, by a temporall generation, as he is man. For the power of the Higheſt ouerſhadowed the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: therefore that holy thing which was borne of her, was called the Sonne of God, <hi>Lu.</hi> 1.35. None were the ſonnes of God thus, but Chriſt alone. Elect men are ſonnes of God, but this is by adoption, and not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Chriſt is the onely begotten of the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this teach vs to take notice, that Chriſt is very God; for as a man begets a man like vnto his owne kind, ſo God in like manner muſt needs beget a God; for elſe we ſhould make God more impotent then man, yea then any other creature; for euery like begets his like.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:10122:90"/>
               <p>Secondly, let it teach vs to admire Gods Philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie or loue to man, in that he vouchſafed to giue his Sonne, his beloued Sonne, his onely begotten Sonne, to the death; yea, to the execrable death of the croſſe, and that for his enemies. O vnſpeakeable loue! O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable mercy!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let it encourage vs to pray vnto the Father in the name of Chriſt: What will God deny vs if we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our petitions in his Sonnes name? Surely nothing. Whatſoeuer ye ſhall aske the Father in my name, he wil giue it you: ſo ſaith our bleſſed Sauiour himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That beloued one.</hi> Whence we may note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ is beloued of God after an eſpeciall manner.</hi> He is that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued one. God loueth the world, and he loueth all his workes, as they are his workes: he loueth the elect Angels, and he loueth his elect amongſt men. But he loueth Chriſt aboue all, and that for iuſt cauſe. Chriſt is beſt worthy to be beloued: firſt, becauſe of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; he is the brightneſſe of Gods glorie, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe image of his perſon, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is moſt innocent, he neuer ttanſgreſſed the will of his Father at any time; he finiſhed the worke which was giuen him to do, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.4.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he layd downe his life, that he might take it vp againe, therefore the Father loued him, <hi>Iohn</hi> chap. 10. verſe 17.</p>
               <p>Many other reaſons might be alledged, to proue that Chriſt is chiefly beloued of the Father, but we will not inſiſt vpon them. Wee will rather anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections which may be made to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Some may obiect poſſibly that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.23. where
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10122:90"/> it is ſaid, that God hath loued his people with the ſame loue, wherewith he hath loued Chriſt himſelfe. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, It is meant of the ſame kinde of loue, but not of the ſame degree.</p>
               <p>Againe, if any ſhall obiect further, that God gaue his Sonne Chriſt for the redemption of the elect world, and therefore that hee loued the elect world better then Chriſt: I anſwere, It followeth not: For, God did not ſo giue his Sonne, as vtterly to part with him; he gaue him indeede to ſuffer death, but he gaue him not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely away.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if any ſhall obiect, that the Father did not ſo tenderly loue Chriſt as this text may ſeeme to imply, becauſe he ſuffered him to liue ſo poore in the world, ſo deſpiſedly; becauſe he ſuffered him to be ſo wronged, to die ſuch a death, yea becauſe he ſtood not by him in his afflictions, but forſooke him: I anſwere, We muſt not iudge of the loue of God, or of his hatred by theſe outward things. The Sunne doth not alwaies ſhine to vs, but it alwaies ſhines in the firmament. So the loue of God doth not alwaies appeare, but it is alwaies feruent in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this teach vs the more to admire Gods loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, in that he would giue his Sonne whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo deerely, for our redemption; yea, it muſt teach vs to be content to part with whatſoeuer we loue beſt for Gods cauſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let it be matter of comfort to the children of God: For, certainly if God hath not ſpared his Sonne whom he loued ſo deerely, but hath giuen him to death for vs all, how ſhall he not, with him, giue vs all things alſo? As the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:10122:91"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>In whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Theſe words imply or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note vnto vs two points. Firſt, that <hi>God the Father is, and euer was, well pleaſed with Chriſt, and ſecondly, in him, well pleaſed with the Church.</hi> For the firſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> that God the Father is, and euer was well pleaſed with Chriſt himſelfe, it is euident. Firſt, becauſe he is the Sonne of his loue, and can any one hate his ſonne whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth? Secondly, becauſe he neuer tranſgreſſed the will of his Father at any time; and what father is there, but he muſt needes be well pleaſed with ſuch a Sonne? Thirdly, it is manifeſt that Chriſt was highly in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fauour at all times, in that the Father did ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily preſerue him in his infancy, in that he aſſiſted him to doe ſo great workes, in that he heard him at all times, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 11.42. and in that he graced him by an audible voice from heauen: This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But here ſome may poſſibly obiect; Did not Gods wrath ſmoake againſt Chriſt for our ſinnes? Did not Chriſt treade the wine-preſſe of the Fathers wrath? Yea did he not cry my God my God why haſt thou forſaken me, vpon the croſſe? And if ſo, how then is it true that Chriſt was alwaies in fauour with God?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I anſwere: Chriſt endured indeede the wrath of God for ſinne; namely for the ſinnes of the Church; and thus Gods wrath did ſmoake againſt him, and did not ſpare him: but the lord was able to diſtinguiſh betwixt Chriſts perſon and our ſinnes, and to expreſſe his wrath againſt ſinne, but yet to be well pleaſed with his Sonne.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this teach vs not to iudge of the fauour or hatred of God, meerely by outward ſence. God was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Chriſt, when Chriſt in the meane time endured
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10122:91"/> perſecution and pouerty, a ſhamefull death; yea, the pangs of hell in his ſoule, in the Garden, and vpon the croſſe. God hid his countenance from Chriſt, in his greateſt extreamitie, and yet Chriſt was in great fauour with him. And ſo I ſay to poore deiected Chriſtians, though they may be in great extremitie for a time, as though God had vtterly forſaken them, yet let them not deſpaire: they may be in baſe eſtate for the preſent, and yet be highly fauoured of God, with the virgin <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1.48.28. They may, poſſibly, cry out with Chriſt, my God my God, why haſt thou forſaken me; and yet indeede be in great fauour with God, as we ſee in this text.</p>
               <p>But to come to the ſecond point. As God was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies well pleaſed with his Sonne; ſo, in him, he is well pleaſed with his Church: And the ſame point is alſo implyed in theſe words; <hi>In whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> For the proofe of the point, I referre the reader to that in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 2.16; where it is ſaid, that Chriſt hath reconciled both Iewes and Gentiles to God, in one body, by the croſſe. And to that in <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.20. where it is ſaid of Chriſt, that hee made peace through the blood of his croſſe, and reconciled all things in heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> If any ſhall obiect that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.40. that Gods wrath was kindled againſt his people, in ſo much that he abhorred his owne inheritance, and therefore that God is not fully reconciled to his Church, or throughly well pleaſed with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> I anſwere. God indeede is neuer well pleaſed with ſinne, but he will viſite our tranſgreſſions with a rod. He is not ſo mercifull but he will ſtill appeare to be iuſt. But
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10122:92"/> let vs aſſure our ſelues of this, that though the Lord be diſpleaſed at our infirmities; yet vpon our Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, he is graciouſly well pleaſed with our perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this teach vs to be thankefull for the inualuable gift of Chriſt, our excellent peace-maker; had it not beene for him, the wrath of God had remained vpon vs, for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let it be matter of comfort to all them which mourne in Zion. It may be thou feeleſt nothing but wrath; but be of good comfort, if thou beeſt a new creature, all thy ſinnes are waſhed away in the blood of Chriſt, and thou art fully reconciled to God, and God is well pleaſed with thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let this teach vs to labour to get Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may apply this reconciliation, wrought by Chriſt, vnto our ſelues, that we may be aſſured in our owne conſciences, that God is well pleaſed with vs. I marueile how any can eate, or drinke, or lie downe in their beds with any peace, without this aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Before we paſſe from this verſe, it ſhall not be altogether impertinent to cleare one ſcruple which may ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> why the Apoſtle doth not relate the whole ſpeech which came from heauen, but doth cut it off, as it were, in the middeſt; for the ſpeech compleately related is this: This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed, heare ye him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. now why doth the Apoſtle leaue out this clauſe, Heare ye him? Which may ſeeme to be as neceſſary as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the ſpeech; for, is it not as neceſſary that we ſhould heare Chriſt as our great Prophet, as know him to be the beloued Sonne of God; or Know that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10122:92"/> God is well pleaſed with him? Surely yes.</p>
               <p>I anſwere: The Apoſtle doth leaue out this clauſe, Heare ye him, for diuers reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the former part of the ſpeech doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the latter as a neceſſary conſequence, though it be not expreſſed. For if Chriſt be the beloued Sonne of God, then certainly, we ought to heare him; according to that in <hi>Math.</hi> 21.37. They will reuerence my Sonne, that is, they will ſurely heare him, and giue entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle may leaue out this ſpeech, Heare ye him, becauſe he knew it was ſufficiently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in other places of Scripture, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.35.</p>
               <p>But the point hence to be gathered is this, namely that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The Scriptures haue a neceſſary dependence one vpon another, and one place expounds another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is manifeſt out of the Text, for theſe words Heare ye him, being wanting in the Text, are ſupplied out of the Euangeliſts, namely, out of the forenamed places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Luke.</hi> 9.35.</p>
               <p>The like we reade in <hi>Math.</hi> 26.51. where the name of him which drew his ſword and ſmote the ſeruant of the high Prieſt, and cut off his eare, is not expreſſed, no nor yet the name of him which was ſmitten. But that which is wanting in <hi>Matthew,</hi> is ſupplied in <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.10. where both the name of the ſmiter is expreſſed <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter,</hi> and the name of the perſon ſmitten, to wit, <hi>Malchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, whereas it is ſaid more obſcurely that the diſciples had indignation, ſaying, To what purpoſe is this waſte, as though many diſciples had murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10122:93"/> the powring of the ſweete ointment vpon the head of Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.8. The ſame is made more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.4. where it is ſaid that one of the Diſciples ſaid, to wit, <hi>Iudas Iſcariot, Symons</hi> ſonne; Why was not this ointment ſold, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas it is more obſcurely ſaid <hi>Math.</hi> 27.44. that the theeues which were crucified with Chriſt, did vpbraid him, as though both the malefactors had railed vpon Chriſt: The ſame is made more manifeſt in <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. where it is ſaid, that one of the malefactors which were hanged rayled on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> Here it may be demanded, wherefore the Spirit of God doth not fully expreſſe himſelfe in euery Text, but leaues ſome thing vncleared in this or that place, by ſome other text elſe-where in Scripture to be cleared and expounded?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Firſt, in honour of the worde it ſelfe, that it might not be deſpiſed for the plaineneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the ſingular wiſedome of God, who will by this meanes giue occaſion to his children to ſearch the Scriptures, and to acquaint themſelues with the whole word of God.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="18" type="verse">
               <p>
                  <hi>We heard.</hi> Whence we may note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods voice is an audible voice.</hi> The Lord ſpoke from heauen, and his voice was heard and vnderſtood, as appeareth in this Text and the like. We reade in <hi>Iſay</hi> 30.30. The Lord ſhall cauſe his glorious voice to be heard, and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.33. He ſendeth forth his voice, and that a mightie voice, and in <hi>Marke</hi> 15.34. At the ninth houre Ieſus cried with a loude voice, <hi>Eloi eloi lama ſabachthani,</hi> and in 37. verſe of the ſame Chapter, Ieſus cried with aloude voice, and gaue vp the Ghoſt.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:10122:93"/>
               <p>The voice of God is ſo mighty, as that the inſenſible creatures are ſenſible of it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.26. Whoſe voice then ſhooke the earth, but now he hath promiſed ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Yet onee more I ſhake not the earth onely, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſo heauen.</p>
               <p>Yea, the dead ſhall heare the voice of the Sonne of God in their very graues at the laſt daie, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.25.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The audibleneſſe of Gods voice may ſerue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince vs of his mighty power; a ſtrong voice argueth the ſtrength of the ſpeaker; and ſo the mightineſſe of Gods voice doth argue the mightineſſe of his power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may teach vs Miniſters which ſpeake in Gods ſtead, not to fauour our ſelues too much, but to ſtraine our ſelues, that we may be heard of the people, and to extend our voices if it be neceſſary to make them audible. And this the Lord requireth, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.1. Crie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude, ſpare not, lift vp thy voice like a trumpet, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may teach people to do what in them lies, to eleuate the voice of their Miniſter. They muſt pray for him, that God would open vnto him the doore of vtterance, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 6.19. Secondly, they muſt not daunt his ſpirit by diſcouragements, but rather put life into him by their encouragements, <hi>Ioſua</hi> 1.18. where the people ſay vnto <hi>Ioſua,</hi> Only be ſtrong, and of a good courage. Thirdly, they muſt beware of rebellion againſt Gods word and diſobedience; for rebellion and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience are an eſpeciall cauſe that the tongue of the Prophet doth cleaue to the roofe of his mouth, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it muſt teach vs to be thankefull, in that the voice of God, I meane the voice of the Miniſtrie, is ſo audible amongſt vs: in that we haue ſo many ſonnes of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10122:94"/> thunders, to ſound the word in our eares. Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the eares of his Diſciples bleſſed, in that they heard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.16. and ſo certainly they were, hauing grace, not onely to heare, but alſo to obey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We were with him.</hi> That is, we three, <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> for theſe were the three which Chriſt led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him when he went into the mountaine where he was transfigured; as appeareth in <hi>Marke</hi> 9.2. And it is a thing to be obſerued, that Chriſt admitted theſe three aboue the reſt of the Apoſtles vnto diuers buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; as when he raiſed <hi>Iairus</hi> his daughter, he ſuffered no man to goe in with him, ſaue <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the father and mother of the maide, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.57. Alſo, when he went apart to pray, he tooke <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> with him, commanding the reſt of his Diſciples to ſtay behind in a place which he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, <hi>Marke</hi> 14.33.</p>
               <p>And ſo here when Chriſt went to be transfigured, he tooke with him <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon may be; firſt, becauſe <hi>Iames, Cephas</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeemed to be Pillars, as we reade, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was out of Chriſts owne freedome; it was lawfull for Chriſt freely to vouchſafe certaine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges vnto theſe three, which he would not vouchſafe the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We were with him.</hi> Whence obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall priuiledge to be conuerſant with Chriſt.</hi> So it is pleaded here; we were with him when others were not admitted. We ſee by experience, that it is a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be familiar with great men: for great perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges will not be familiar with euerie one, neither is it fit they ſhould. How much more then is it a priuiledge to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10122:94"/> haue familiaritie with God?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the benefits receiued by familiaritie with God, do proue it to be an eſpeciall priuiledge. For firſt, by being familiar or conuerſant with Chriſt, we learne many things; according to that in <hi>Prou.</hi> 13.20. He that walketh with wiſe men, ſhall be wiſe. Secondly, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuerſant with Chriſt, we receiue contentment and ioy, as it is ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.20. But the friend of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome which ſtandeth and heareth him, reioyceth greatly becauſe of the Bridegroomes voice. Thirdly, by being conuerſant with Chriſt, we are in ſafety. This <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> acknowledgeth in his twentieth chapter and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth verſe: The Lord is with me as a mighty terrible one; therefore my perſecuters ſhall ſtumble, and they ſhall not preuaile.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But ſome may poſſibly obiect: Yea but if any be continually in Chriſts preſence, he muſt walke very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately; he muſt not ſpeake an idle word, nor haue a wanton looke. And this degree of preciſeneſſe may ſeeme rather to be a bondage then a priuiledge. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a bondage to the wicked and graceleſſe, to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in true holineſſe: but vnto the childe of God it is the ſweeteſt freedome in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let it therefore teach vs to labour for this priuiledge (to wit) to walke with God, and to be conuerſant with him; and that we may attaine thereunto, obſerue we theſe directions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt be conuerſant in the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3. That which we haue ſeene and heard, declare we vnto you, that yee alſo may haue fellowſhip with vs; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Ieſus Chriſt. Secondly, we muſt beware of ſinne; for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10122:95"/> God will haue no fellowſhip with the ſtoole of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and, If we ſay, that we haue fellowſhip with him, and walke in darkeneſſe, we lie, and do not the truth, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.6. Thirdly, we muſt be very conuerſant in works of holineſſe. For, where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Chriſts name, there is he in the midſt of them, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let it alſo teach Chriſtians which are partakers of this priuiledge of hauing fellowſhip with God, to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. As <hi>Henock</hi> was much bound to God for this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> euen ſo art thou which enioyeſt this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though it be in an inferior degree. If a King ſhould admit thee into great familiaritie with him, and thou ſhouldeſt deſpiſe it, and make light of it, were it not moſt iuſt for him to caſhiere thee out of his preſence, and to depriue thee of his princely familiarity? Euen ſo, if God vouchſafe to be familiar with thee, and thou prize it not, how iuſt is it for him to hide his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from thee, and to depriue thee of his familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Laſtly, this ſheweth the miſerie of the wicked; for they are not partakers of this priuiledge of hauing fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt, but their fellowſhip is with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels; with them they conuerſe, with them they conſult, of them they are taught, and them they obey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the holy mount.</hi> Here it may be demanded, Why Chriſt was tranſfigured rather in a mountaine then in a valley? This might be for this reaſon, namely, that the eminency of the place, might put the Apoſtles in minde to lift their hearts vp vnto God, and to haue their mindes aboue in this holy buſineſſe. For what was the reaſon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10122:95"/> that the Temple was built vpon an hill, but for the ſame cauſe? And what was the cauſe that <hi>Abraham</hi> went vp into the mountaine to offer his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but for the ſame reaſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let this teach vs in heauenly matters, to haue our hearts aboue. Heauenly actions ſhould be performed with an heauenly minde; and that we may doe ſo, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue we theſe rules. Firſt, we muſt empty our mindes of worldly occaſions, before we come into Gods houſe; we muſt leaue theſe as ſeruants, at the foote of the hill, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. 2. We muſt vndertake holy buſineſſes with preparation. 3. We muſt beware of ſuch obiects as diſperſe our thoughts in the time of Gods ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holy mount.</hi> Why was this mountaine called holy, more then another mountaine? Surely not in reſpect of the earth or matter whereof it conſiſted, but becauſe of Gods preſence.</p>
               <p>The point hence to be obſerued is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>Euery place, during the time of Gods eſpeciall preſence and holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, is holy.</hi> Yea, the very open fields and mountains are holy vpon this occaſion; as we reade, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5: <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> come not nigh, put off thy ſhoes, the place where thou ſtandeſt is holy ground. Hence it is that Gods temple is tearmed an holy Temple in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.7. and in diuers other places of the <hi>Pſalmes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This makes againſt them which carry themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerently in the houſe of God, and that in the very time of Gods ordinances, either by ſleeping or gazing, or by pride, or by ſtealing, &amp;c. Of theſe it may truly bee ſaid; Thine holy Temple haue they defiled; and, My Fathers houſe is the houſe of prayer, but you haue made it a denne of theeues.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:10122:96"/>
               <p>Secondly, this muſt teach vs to reuerence Gods San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, as we are taught, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.30. Whileſt we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſhunne the ſuperſtitious opinions which idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue of their Temples, we muſt take heede that we fall not into the other extremitie, to wit, to haue a baſe opinion of Gods houſe.</p>

            <div n="19" type="verse">
               <p>
                  <hi>We haue a more ſure word of Prophecy:</hi> Or, as it is in the originall: We haue a more ſure Propheticall word: as though the Apoſtle had ſaid, That which I write vnto you concerning Chriſt, it was confirmed not only by a liuely voice of God the Father from heauen; but alſo by the Canonicall writings of the holy Prophets.</p>
               <p>Whence we are to obſerue, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The Goſpell of Chriſt is an infallible truth.</hi> It hath witneſſe both from God and man. That it hath witnes immediatly from God, it is euident by the voice which came from heauen: This is my welbeloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed; heare him: And that from man it is manifeſt; for vnto Chriſt doe all the Prophets giue witneſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. Yea, all the Prophets, from <hi>Samuel,</hi> and thoſe that follow after, as many as haue ſpoken, haue alſo foretold of theſe dayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.24.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe is that in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.60. He hath rayſed vp an horne of ſaluation for vs, in the houſe of his ſeruant <hi>Dauid,</hi> as he ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets which haue beene ſince the world began: And that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they which teſtifie of me. In a word, Chriſt was written of in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This muſt ſerue to confirme our faith concerning Chriſt, that he is the true Meſſiah; and concerning
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10122:96"/> his Goſpell, that it is no other but the very truth. If we will not beleeue both God himſelfe and all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whom ſhould we beleeue?</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may ſerue alſo to aggrauate the ſinne of atheiſme and infidelitie. What doe theſe curſed ſinners but giue God himſelfe and all his Prophets the lie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A more ſure word.</hi> That is, a more ſure word then that which came downe from heauen, ſaying; This is my beloued Sonne, &amp;c. Here it may be demanded, how the Apoſtle can ſpeake this without blaſphemy; for that voice which came downe from heauen, was the voice of God himſelfe, then the which, what could poſſibly be more ſure?</p>
               <p>Some, for the clearing of this doubt, affirme, that the Comparatiue degree here is put for the Poſitiue: We haue a more ſure word, that is (ſay they) we haue a ſure word; but we cannot agree to their iudgement: but taking the words as they are in the text, my ſentence is, That the word of the Prophets is ſaid to be a more ſure word then that voice which came from heauen, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was more true, but becauſe it was of more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie with the people vnto whom <hi>Peter</hi> wrote. They diſtruſted not the voice that came from heauen: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other voices they kept themſelues cloſe to the voice of Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Hence learne we <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>To prize the ſentences and ſpeeches of Scripture aboue all other ſentences and ſpeeches whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</hi>Let vs eſteeme the Scripture the ſureſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the proofe of this point I referre the Reader to that in the ſecond epiſtle of <hi>Iohn</hi> tenth verſe; If there come any vnto you, and bring not this doctrine, receiue him not to houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed: and to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10122:97"/> that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. Though we, or an Angell from heauen preach any other goſpell vnto you then that which we haue preached vnto you, let him be accurſed.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But here ſome may poſſibly obiect, That the Church is ſaid to be the pillar and ground of truth, 1. <hi>Timothie</hi> chapter 3. verſe 15. and therefore, that we ought rather to depend vpon the authority of the Church then vpon the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> I anſwer: The Church is ſo termed, not in reſpect of it ſelfe, but in reſpect of its Miniſterie; euen as <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were counted to be pillars, not for their perſons, but for their doctrine, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.9. So that the place rightly vnderſtood, doeth rather confirme the authority of the word, then in any ſort infringe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> Let vs learne therefore to keepe cloſe to the word of God, and to ground our faith vpon it alone.

               <p>

                  <hi>It is the duty of all Chriſtians to giue diligent heed to the word of God, it is manifeſt:</hi> For if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and euery tranſgreſſion &amp; diſobedience receiued a iuſt recompence of reward: how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſaluation? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2.3.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> But, what is it to haue reſpect or to giue heede to the word of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> It is, firſt, diligently to frequent the houſe of God, where it is faithfully taught. Secondly, to marke and to hearken carefully to it whileſt it is deliuered. Thirdly, to examine our ſelues by it, and to make conſcience to practiſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may ſerue iuſtly to reproue multitudes at theſe dayes wherein we liue: firſt, ſuch as are negligent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to the Church. Secondly, ſuch as come to the Church, but attend not as they ought to the word, but ſuffer their mindes and ſenſes to be carried after other matters. Thirdly, ſuch as come and hearken to the word, but go their way againe without any purpoſe to practiſe any iot of that which they heare. All theſe are negligent hearers, they attend not to the word of God, or they take not heed vnto it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond doctrine propounded is, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable thing to take heede to the word.</hi> To the which taking heed ye do well, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For what did our Sauiour ſo highly commend <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42? but becauſe ſhe had choſen the good part, that is, attended vpon the hearing of the word for the attaining of ſaluation. And, for what were the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeans ſo highly commended? <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. but becauſe they ſearched the Scriptures, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And to heare and take heed to the word muſt needes be commendable: firſt, becauſe it is an honeſt practiſe. Secondly, becauſe it is a godly practiſe. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is, and hath beene the practiſe of all Saints from generation to generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerues iuſtly to condemne the practiſe of them
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10122:98"/> which rayle againſt going to ſermons, againſt reading Gods word, and other holy duties. Theſe rayling <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhachees</hi> ſhould conſider, that it were their duty rather to commend theſe practiſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may ſerue to teach vs, neuer to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of this practiſe of taking heede to the word of God; though all the world ſhould caſt contempt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, yet the thing in it ſelfe is truly commendable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this may ſerue to encourage all ſuch as giue diligent heede to the word of God, alwaies prouided, that they be carefull to follow two callings, <hi>viz.</hi> both their generall calling, and alſo their particular. A true Chriſtian muſt ſo heare, as that he ſtill haue time to earne his owne bread; and he muſt ſo labour for things neceſſary for this life, as that ſtill he haue his religious houres euery day to attend vnto Gods word either read or preached.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye doe well.</hi> Whence obſerue in the third place, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the dutie of Miniſters to encourage the people in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods word, by due commendation giuen vnto them for the ſame.</hi> Thus doth <hi>Peter</hi> in this Text, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that his auditory did giue diligent heede to the things that were ſpoken; he animateth them with this commendation, <hi>Vnto the which giuing heede ye doe well.</hi> The like practiſe we obſerue in <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2: Now I commend you brethren that you remember me in all things, and keepe the ordinances as I deliuered them vnto you. And in 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6: Ye became followers of vs and of the Lord, hauing receiued the word in much affliction with ioy in the holy Ghoſt. So that ye were enſamples to all that beleeue in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:10122:99"/>
               <p>The like practiſe we ſee in Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.21. My mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my brethren are theſe which heare the word of God, and doe it; he ſo farre commendeth the diligent hearers of Gods word, that he ſeemeth to preferre them before his mother which brought him into the world. The like we ſee in the ſame our bleſſed Sauiour in <hi>Reu.</hi> 3.8. where he commendeth the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for keeping his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And there is good ground for it, that a Miniſter may and ought to commend the people for their diligent heede giuen vnto the word. As firſt, becauſe it may be a meanes to encourage them in their zeale, yea, to make them more zealous. Secondly, becauſe it may be a meanes to ſtirre vp others, which are as yet negligent of the word, to become zealous hearers of the ſame. Thirdly, becauſe a Miniſter ſhall hereby diſcharge a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall good dutie to God, though no ſucceſſe ſhould follow vpon the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">1.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">2. Obiection.</note> Others may likewiſe obiect, that it is not ſafe for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, of all other, to commend people for taking heede to the word of God; becauſe this were the way to come to be ſuſpected of vaine-glorie, or of going about to draw diſciples after him: ſo, if a Miniſter ſhall giue almes, he ſhall finde ſome that will taxe him for hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; or if he preach earneſtly againſt ſinne; ſome, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, will ſay he is too buſie or contentious: But a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10122:99"/> in this caſe, muſt paſſe very little to be iudged of mans iudgement, there is one which iudgeth him, which is the Lord. Let a Miniſter doe that which is pleaſing to God, though all the world ſhould cenſure him for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may ſerue iuſtly to reproue too many Miniſters, which reproue people for taking heede to the word, thinking them to be too forward, if they be zealous to heare: But let ſuch know, it were their dutie rather to commend ſuch people, and to bleſſe God for them, and to turne the edge of their reproach vpon profane negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the ordinance of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach Gods people, to giue ſuch heede vnto the word, and to be ſo diligent in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and attending, and to carry themſelues ſo reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the houſe of God, as that Miniſters may haue iuſt cauſe to commend them, and to reioyce of them. Euery one could be content to be praiſed, but how few be there which labour to deſerue prayſe?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſhould teach vs to be thankefull to our gracious God, in that he is not only content to accept of our zeale and forwardneſſe, but alſo is willing that we ſhould be commended for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As vnto a light.</hi> Whence note this point, <hi>viz.</hi> that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>the word is a light.</hi> And for proofe hereof, I referre you to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105: Thy word is a Lampe vnto my feete, and a light vnto my path: and 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.9: The darkeneſſe is paſt, and the true light now ſhineth: and <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.35. Ye could haue reioyced in his light for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loued darkeneſſe rather then light.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:10122:100"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And indeede the word of God may well be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to light. Firſt, becauſe as light is an incorruptible thing; though it ſhine vpon a ſtinking dunghill, yet it is not corrupted: Euen ſo the word is vncorruptible ſeede, as <hi>Peter</hi> termeth it 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. And though it be preached to neuer ſo baſe perſons, yet it receiueth no tainture or infection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe as light diſcouereth the ſoulneſſe of the roome or place where it ſhineth; euen ſo doth the word diſcouer the iniquitie of ſuch places where it is preached. A man ſitting in a darke houſe in the night, may thinke he ſits in a cleane place; but when the Sunne ariſeth in the morning, then hee plainlie diſcerneth the contrarie: Euen ſo people being in darkeneſſe, may, poſſibly, thinke themſelues to be in a cleane eſtate; but when the word of God comes, it quickly diſcouereth that they are not cleanſed from their filthineſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe as the light, in reſpect of the obiect, hath a contrarie effect: For ſhining vpon a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſe, it cauſeth to ſmell the more odiouſly; but ſhining vpon hearbs it maketh them the more fragrant. Euen ſo the word is the fauor of death vnto death vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, but the ſauor of life vnto life, vnto the elect. It hath a contrary effect in reſpect of the hearers, though it be one and the ſame in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſtion.</note> Is it then in the power of the word to enlighten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit? Not ſo, for as the Spirit ordinarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word will not worke; ſo the word without the Spirit cannot worke. The word may fitly be compared to a Torch, and the Spirit to the fire which kindleth it; The Torch is a fit inſtrument to gaine light by, but yet vnleſſe it be lighted it giueth no ſhine: So the word is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10122:100"/> a fit inſtrument to enlighten the eyes of the blinde, but yet vnleſſe the Spirit doe kindle it, it can giue no ſauing light.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The vſe of this point may be, firſt, to diſcouer the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe why the word is ſo hated by lewde and wicked men. It is becauſe it is a light, and diſcouereth their naughtineſſe. What doth the theefe or the adulterer hate more, then if any come with a candle to reueale his practiſes? Hence it is that our Sauiour ſaith in <hi>Iohn</hi> the third chapter, and the twenty verſe: Euery one that doeth euill hateth the light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this maketh for the iuſt condemnnation of vngodly men, that when light is come into the world yet loue darkneſſe more then light, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. How many wretched perſons be there in the world, that when for the preſent they haue the light of the Goſpell, are weary of that, and deſire rather the times of Popery wherein they might be nuzled vp in blindneſſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſhould teach euery one of vs to be thankfull vnto God for the word, as for a comfortable light; and to labour to be ſenſible, how we ſhould fit in darkeneſſe and in the ſhadow of death, were it not for this bleſſed lampe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it ſhould teach vs, whileſt we haue the light to walke in the light, leſt darkneſſe come vpon vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.35. Yea, being children of the light, we muſt walke as children of the light. We that haue light muſt not ſtumble and fall, as they that walke in the darke; but we muſt walke honeſtly as in the day, not in ryoting and drunkenneſſe; not in chambering and wantonneſſe, nor in ſtrife and enuying, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. But alas my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

                  </gap> the leſt, that we walk not as children of the light. I ſpeake this to our ſhame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a darke place.</hi> That is, in the heart vnregenerate. Whence obſerue we this inſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The heart of euery vnregenerate man, is a darke and obſcure dungeon; yea, a darke hell or hades, wherein there is no ſauing light or knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For proofe of this, conſider theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. They became vaine in their imagination, and their fooliſh heart was darkened, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.15. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which ſate in darkeneſſe haue ſeene great light, and to them which ſate in the region and ſhadow of death, light is ſprong vp. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.78.76: To giue light to them which ſit in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhadowe of death. <hi>Iſay</hi> 60.2. Behold the darkeneſſe ſhall couer the earth, and groſſe darkeneſſe the people. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. You were once darkeneſſe. And, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.5. They know not, neither will they vnderſtand, they walke on in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And an vnregenerate heart, may well be compared to a darke place. Firſt, becauſe as a darke place is without light, ſo is the vnregenerate heart. <hi>Iſay</hi> 8.20. If they ſpeake not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe as a darke place is a fit receptacle for deboyſht and lewde perſons; euen ſo the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart, is a fit receptacle for diuels and foule ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.20. When the ſtrong man armed keeps the houſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe as men commonly are not aſhamed
<pb facs="tcp:10122:101"/> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> which they play in ſecret, becauſe they thinke no eye ſeeth them; ſo whatſoeuer ſinnes an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſon, in his darke eſtate, committeth, he is farre from being aſhamed of the ſame. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.15: Were they aſhamed when they had committed abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Nay, they were not aſhamed, neither could they bluſh.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe as darke places are commonly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and vnſauorie: Euen ſo is an vnregenerate heart foule and filthy in the ſight of God; no dungeon, no ſinke, no vault is ſo ſtinking in our noſtrils as an vnſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified heart is in the noſtrils of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1: They are corrupt. It is a Metaphor taken from things which are putrified for want of ſalt: Becauſe as that which is putrified, ſendeth forth an ill ſauor, ſo doth a putrified and rotten heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Yea, but many vnregenerate perſons may haue great knowledge in religion, therefore how is their hearts a darke place? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Not becauſe they haue no knowledg at all, but becauſe they haue no ſauing knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> The conſideration of this point, may ſerue to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all vnregenerate perſons; let them remember that their fooliſh hearts are full of darkeneſſe, and therefore let them not magnifie themſelues in reſpect of naturall wit; let them be more humbled for that excellent light which they want, then puffed vp, in any ſort, for that vnſufficient light which they haue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach vs to loath our ſelues in reſpect of our naturall condition. What were we but darkeneſſe and corruption before our effectuall calling? Is thy heart now a lightſome Temple? remember that in times paſt, it was a darke dungeon.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:10122:102"/>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſhould ſerue to conuince vs of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the vſe of enlightening meanes; as of hearing Gods word preached, and the like. We are in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe naturally, and therefore haue neede of light; and what meanes is it ordinarily that doth turne men from darkeneſſe to light, but Gods word truely preached? <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vntill the day dawne.</hi> By the dawning of the day, and the day-ſtarre, in this place, we are to vnderſtand effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all illumination, or the gift of Chriſt, as it is explaned, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.78.</p>
               <p>And effectuall illumination, or the gift of Chriſt, is fitly compared to the dawning. Firſt, becauſe as the dawning is but a ſmall light at the firſt; euen ſo illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the firſt is but ſmall. <hi>Iob.</hi> 26.14: Loe theſe are part of his waies, but how little a portion is heard of him?</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe as the dawning, though it bring but a little light at the firſt, yet it brings great ioy, both to man and beaſt; ſo effectuall illumination, though it be weake as the firſt, yet being in truth, it bringeth ioy to the Angels; for the very Angels reioyce of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of a ſinner, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. It bringeth ioy to the friends of a conuert: for what true friend is there but he reioyceth to ſee his friend conuerted? It bringeth ioy to God himſelfe; for the father of the prodigall reioyceth to ſee the returne of his prodigall and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſonne. It bringeth ioy to the Church of God; for what true member is there, but he reioyceth to ſee the body of Chriſt to be more and more perfected? Laſtly, it bringeth comfort, or at the leaſt matter of comfort to the party himſelfe which is enlightened. Doth not a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10122:102"/> man reioyce to ſee the light ſhine in at the window, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a darke and diſmall night? how much more hath he cauſe to reioyce, in that he himſelfe, who was darkneſſe, is now made light in the Lord?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as the dawning though it be but a ſmall light at the firſt, yet it groweth greater and greater vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the perfect day. So it is with true illumination; It is a growing light. <hi>Prou.</hi> 4.18. But the path of the iuſt is as a ſhining light, which ſhineth more and more till the perfect day.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as the dawning is procured by the light of the Sunne; euen ſo true illumination floweth from Chriſt, as from the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe: The day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring which viſiteth vs is from on high, that is, from Chriſt, <hi>Lu.</hi> 1.78. And God which cauſed light to ſhine out of darkeneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts, to giue the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, in ſome meaſure, the reaſons why true illumination is compared to the dawning.</p>
               <p>Againe, we are to note further, that as it is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the dawning; ſo it is likewiſe to the morning Starre: and that for theſe reaſons: firſt, becauſe as the morning Starre is a beautifull creature, ſo is grace much more glorious. Secondly, as the morning Starre is the fore-runner of the Sunne, or of a greater light then it ſelfe: ſo grace is the fore-runner of glory. Thirdly, as the morning Starre vaniſheth when the Sunne appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; ſo faith, which is one of the firſt graces, it vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth away, when Chriſt ſhall appeare, and when we ſhall receiue that which we beleeued or hoped for.</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10122:106"/> The way to know it, is, firſt, to know the words of this Text, and to beleeue them. Secondly, to pray God to conuince our conſciences of the truth of them, that ſo we may beleeue them. Thirdly, to conſider that the whole Scripture was giuen by the inſpiration of God; and being ſo, then it muſt needs follow, that none but God knoweth the meaning of them, or can interpret them.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> In the next place, let vs examine whether we know this neceſſary truth, or no. And it may be tried by theſe ſignes and markes.

               <p>Laſtly, let ſuch as know, that the Scripture is not of priuate interpretation, be thankefull vnto God for this knowledge.

               <p>
                  <hi>Holy men of God.</hi> The next point to be conſidered, concerning the Prophets and Apoſtles, is that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>They were men of God.</hi> Thus they were acknowledged in diuers places, as in 1. <hi>King</hi> 13.1. Behold there came a man of God to him ſaying, &amp;c. And ſo in my Text.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And thus they were fitly tearmed. Firſt, becauſe they had their calling from God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle not of man, neither by man, but by Ieſus Chriſt, and God the Father which rayſed him from the dead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they ſtood mainly for God, ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to promote his glory in all things: <hi>Ro.</hi> 3.4. Let God be true, and euery man a liar.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe they were excellent men, euen as the great and excellent Cedars, are tearmed Cedars of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10122:108"/> God in the Hebrew, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.10. So are the Prophets and Apoſtles called men of God, becauſe they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men.</p>

               <p>Secondly, let it teach vs not to nick-name Gods Miniſters. The Spirit of God can vouchſafe here to giue them a reuerent name, as we ſee, men of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let it teach vs Miniſters to carry our ſelues, not as ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> but as men of God. Let vs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to walke worthy of thoſe Titles which the holy Ghoſt doth giue vnto vs in the Scripture. What auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, my brethren, to haue a name to liue, and in the meane time to be dead? <hi>Reuelation</hi> the third chapter, and the firſt verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holy men of God.</hi> The third and laſt thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, concerning the Prophets and Apoſtles, is that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>They were holy men.</hi> And the truth of this point is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by theſe places of Scripture following: <hi>Luke</hi> 1.70. As he ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.5. Which in other ages was not made knowne to the ſonnes of men, as it is now reuealed vnto the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets by the Spirit. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. Whom the heauens muſt receiue vntill the times of reſtitution of al things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the world began. By all which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and many more, the point is, and might be proued.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon.</note> And the Prophets and Apoſtles are fitly termed holy men: firſt, becauſe they were ſanctified of God, and ſet
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10122:108"/> apart to this holy calling of prophecie and Apoſtleſhip, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſeparated to the Goſpel of God: Secondly, becauſe they were holy and deuout men: they were not profane <hi>Eſaus,</hi> but true ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified perſons; as <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledgeth concerning himſelf, Preſerue thou my ſoule, for I am holy, <hi>Pſal. 86.</hi>2.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſhould teach vs the more to delight in the word, it is the writing of holy men. Secondly, it ſhould teach thoſe that are in authority in the Church of God, what kinde of men they ſhould eſpecially admit for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, namely holy men. Thirdly, it teacheth people what kind of men they ought to make choiſe of for their miniſters, if they haue the choice committed vnto them: They ought to make choice eſpecially of holy men: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prouided, that thoſe holy men whom they make choice of, be alſo men of knowledge, and duly gifted. Fourthly, it teacheth vs Miniſters aſwell to endeuour to be holy in our conuerſation, as to be ſound in our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: We ought aſwell to be holy men as to be good teachers: Be cleane ye that beare the veſſels of the Lord, <hi>Eſay</hi> 52.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As they were moued by the holy Ghost.</hi> Whence note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The bookes of canonicall Scripture were giuen by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> They came not by the will of man, but by the motion of the Spirit. For the proofe of this I referre the Reader to that in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. All ſcripture is giuen by the inſpiration of God: and to that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. It is not you that ſpeake, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall here demand, what is meant by the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God: the anſwer is; By the inſpiration of God we are to vnderſtand the worke of Gods Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10122:109"/> he did ſuggeſt and dictate whatſoeuer the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles deliuered for doctrine in their preaching and writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> But how proue you that the holy Ghoſt did prompt the Prophets and Apoſtles in preaching? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> Surely, this may be proued out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2.4. They beganne to ſpeake with other tongues, as the Spirit gaue them vtterance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> And how may it appeare, that the Spirit did indite or dictate that which the Prophets and Apoſtles did write? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> This appeareth by that in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to vs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> If anie ſhall obiect that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12. But to the reſt ſpeake I, not the Lord: <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> The anſwer is; <hi>Paul</hi> indeed had no expreſſe place of the olde Teſtament to prooue that which he did deliuer in that particular; and therefore he ſaith, To the reſt ſpeake I, not the Lord: But yet, in giuing his aduice, he had the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, as is manifeſt in 1. <hi>Corint.</hi> 7.40. But ſhe is happier (in my iudgement) &amp; I think alſo that I haue the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This ſerues to put difference betweene hereticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Scripture. Hereticall writings are by the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the diuell, but Canonicall ſcriptures are by the inſpiration of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, betweene other diuine writings and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for other diuine writings are not without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods holy Spirit; but the Scripture was giuen by extraordinarie immediate reuelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> It muſt teach vs to beware of reproaching the holy Scriptures; in caſting reproaches vpon the word, we caſt reproches vpon the holy Ghoſt himſelfe, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it muſt teach vs to reuerence the Scripture
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:10122:109"/> aboue all other bookes in the world: This is the onelie booke giuen by immediate inſpiration. Herein we muſt eſpecially delight to reade and meditate all the dayes of our liues.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may ſerue alſo for comfort; for if the Scripture came by the inſpiration of God, then certainly there is ſome extraordinarie vertue and power in it: nothing can thus immediatly flow from God, but it muſt be of ſome extraordinarie vigour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As they were moued:</hi> Or, as it is in the Greeke: As they were carried. Whence we are to note, that <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>The holy Ghoſt did ſtrongly reigne in the Prophets and Apoſtles:</hi> It did not onely moue them, but as it were carry them with an holy violence. This is manifeſt out of <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20: We can not but ſpeake the things which we haue ſeene and heard; and out of <hi>Acts</hi> 21.14. where <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo violently moued to go vp to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that all the perſwaſion of his friends, nor the hazard of his life, could not turne him from his purpoſe. And out of 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13.8. We can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth: for ſo the Text is to be rendred, according to the Originall. And out of <hi>Acts</hi> 16.7. After they were come to <hi>Myſta,</hi> they aſſayed to go into <hi>Bythinia,</hi> but the Spirit ſuffered them not. Whence it is manifeſt, that the holy Ghoſt did ſtrongly order the very iournies of the men of God, cauſing them to alter their owne intentions often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and to go another way at his appointment.</p>
               <p>It was with the Prophets and Apoſtles, in this reſpect, as it was with Chriſt himſelfe. For as Chriſt himſelfe was not moued, but driuen of the Spirit into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be tempted of the diuell; for ſo are the words in the original, <hi>Lu.</hi> 4.1. Euen ſo it was with the Prophets &amp;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10122:110"/> Apoſtles, they were acted or driuen by an holy violence of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt is compared to a winde, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. yea to a great ruſhing winde, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3. becauſe, as it bloweth where it liſts, ſo he bloweth or worketh mightily where he liſteth. No ſhip is more violently caried by the winds, then the Prophets and Apoſtles were by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But then it might ſeeme, that the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did nothing willingly, but as it were compulſiuely. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſw.</note> Not ſo, for there is difference betweene compulſion, and holy Violence. Theſe holy men were carried with an holy violence, but they were not compelled; the holy Spirit finding vnwillingneſſe in theſe men of God, he ſubdued that vnwillingnes, and of vnwilling made them willing. This muſt needes be granted; for if they had done that which they did, abſolutely againſt their will, and by meere compulſion, they had loſt their reward, as appeareth in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. If I do this thing willingly, I haue a reward, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Vſe.</note> This may ſerue to cauſe vs to bewaile our coldneſſe of zeale at theſe daies; where is this holy violence of the ſpirit, which ſhould vrge vs to Chriſtian duties? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we reſiſt good motions, &amp; withſtand them? which ſhewes what a poore meaſure of the ſpirit we haue as yet attained. O my beloued, ſhal the Prophets and Apoſtles be carried by the Spirit, and ſhall not we be led by him? ſhall they be vrged by holy motions, and ſhall not we ſo much as be perſwaded by them? The Lord that is able to bow the heauens, bow our mindes to good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs to that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight.</p>
